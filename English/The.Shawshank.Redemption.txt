0:02:05.79,0:02:06.80 Mr. Dufresne
0:02:06.90,0:02:12.29 describe the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered.
0:02:16.99,0:02:18.59 It was very bitter.
0:02:18.99,0:02:23.29 She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around.
0:02:24.89,0:02:28.39 And she said that she wanted a divorce in Reno.
0:02:28.59,0:02:32.29 - What was your response? - I told her I would not grant one.
0:02:32.49,0:02:35.59 "I'll see  you in hell before I see you in Reno."
0:02:35.79,0:02:39.19 Those were your words, according to your neighbors.
0:02:40.19,0:02:41.89 If they say so.
0:02:42.39,0:02:44.89 I really don't remember. I was upset.
0:02:45.19,0:02:47.59 What happened after you argued with your wife?
0:02:48.79,0:02:50.59 She packed a bag.
0:02:51.69,0:02:54.89 She packed a bag to go and stay with Mr. Quentin.
0:02:55.49,0:02:59.49 Glenn Quentin, golf pro at the Snowden Hills Country Club
0:02:59.79,0:03:02.99 whom you had discovered was your wife's lover.
0:03:05.29,0:03:06.49 Did you follow her?
0:03:07.79,0:03:09.89 I went to a few bars first.
0:03:10.09,0:03:14.49 Later, I drove to his house to confront them. They weren't home.
0:03:14.99,0:03:16.59 I parked in the turnout
0:03:17.29,0:03:18.29 and waited.
0:03:18.49,0:03:20.09 With what intention?
0:03:20.79,0:03:22.19 I'm not sure.
0:03:23.29,0:03:24.79 I was confused
0:03:24.99,0:03:25.99 drunk.
0:03:27.59,0:03:28.89 I think
0:03:29.09,0:03:31.19 mostly I wanted to scare them.
0:03:31.39,0:03:34.79 When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them.
0:03:35.69,0:03:37.09 I was sobering up.
0:03:37.29,0:03:40.99 I got back in the car and I drove home to sleep it off.
0:03:41.19,0:03:44.09 Along the way, I threw my gun into the Royal River.
0:03:44.29,0:03:46.29 I've been very clear on this point.
0:03:46.59,0:03:50.59 I get hazy where the cleaning woman shows up the following morning
0:03:50.79,0:03:53.39 and finds your wife in bed with her lover
0:03:53.69,0:03:55.69 riddled with.38-caliber bullets.
0:03:57.09,0:04:01.09 Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?
0:04:02.19,0:04:03.19 Yes, it does.
0:04:03.39,0:04:06.59 Yet you still maintain you threw your gun into the river
0:04:06.79,0:04:08.89 before the murders took place.
0:04:09.09,0:04:11.29 That's very convenient.
0:04:11.49,0:04:13.19 It's the truth.
0:04:13.49,0:04:18.09 The police dragged that river for three days, and nary a gun was found
0:04:18.29,0:04:22.29 so no comparison could be made between your gun and the bullets
0:04:22.59,0:04:26.09 taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims.
0:04:26.69,0:04:29.09 And that also
0:04:29.59,0:04:32.99 is very convenient. Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?
0:04:34.39,0:04:36.39 Since I am innocent of this crime
0:04:36.59,0:04:41.29 I find it decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found.
0:04:41.36,0:04:43.40 ∮ If I Didn't Care
0:04:47.37,0:04:50.62 ∮ And would I be sure that this
0:04:50.70,0:04:55.29 ∮ Is love beyond compare...
0:04:59.19,0:05:02.49 Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence.
0:05:02.69,0:05:06.59 We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have footprints.
0:05:06.79,0:05:09.59 Bullets on the ground bearing his fingerprints.
0:05:09.79,0:05:12.79 A broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints.
0:05:12.99,0:05:14.59 And most of all
0:05:14.79,0:05:17.79 we have a beautiful young woman and her lover
0:05:17.99,0:05:20.09 lying dead in each other's arms.
0:05:21.19,0:05:23.89 They had sinned.
0:05:25.09,0:05:27.59 But was their crime so great
0:05:27.89,0:05:30.09 as to merit a death sentence?
0:05:30.29,0:05:32.59 While you think about that
0:05:33.99,0:05:35.79 think about this:
0:05:36.69,0:05:40.39 A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.
0:05:40.59,0:05:44.29 I submit that this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion.
0:05:44.49,0:05:47.29 That at least could be understood, if not condoned.
0:05:47.49,0:05:48.59 No.
0:05:48.79,0:05:50.39 This was revenge
0:05:50.40,0:05:54.49 of a much more brutal, cold-blooded nature. Consider this:
0:05:54.69,0:05:57.09 Four bullets per victim.
0:05:57.89,0:05:59.59 Not six shots fired, but eight.
0:06:00.09,0:06:03.69 That means that he fired the gun empty
0:06:03.89,0:06:05.89 and then stopped to reload
0:06:06.09,0:06:09.59 so that he could shoot each of them again.
0:06:09.79,0:06:12.29 An extra bullet per lover
0:06:13.09,0:06:14.89 right in the head.
0:06:18.39,0:06:23.19 You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.
0:06:23.59,0:06:25.69 It chills my blood just to look at you.
0:06:27.69,0:06:30.39 By the power vested in me by the state of Maine
0:06:30.59,0:06:34.89 I hereby order you to serve two life sentences back-to-back
0:06:35.29,0:06:37.79 one for each of your victims. So be it!
0:07:02.89,0:07:04.09 Sit.
0:07:08.59,0:07:11.49 We see you've served 20 years of a life sentence?
0:07:12.39,0:07:15.59 - Yes, sir. - You feel you've been rehabilitated?
0:07:15.99,0:07:18.59 Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.
0:07:19.79,0:07:21.69 I mean, I learned my lesson.
0:07:22.79,0:07:26.29 I can honestly say that I'm a changed man.
0:07:29.49,0:07:31.89 I'm no longer a danger to society.
0:07:32.09,0:07:33.99 That's God's honest truth.
0:08:10.29,0:08:11.59 Hey, Red.
0:08:11.79,0:08:13.09 How'd it go?
0:08:13.29,0:08:15.49 Same old shit, different day.
0:08:15.79,0:08:17.59 Yeah, I know how you feel.
0:08:17.79,0:08:19.79 I'm up for rejection next week.
0:08:20.59,0:08:23.09 Yeah, I got rejected last week.
0:08:23.39,0:08:24.69 It happens.
0:08:24.89,0:08:26.29 Hey, Red, bump me a deck.
0:08:26.49,0:08:29.79 Get out of my face, man! You're into me for five packs already.
0:08:29.99,0:08:30.99 - Four! - Five
0:08:32.09,0:08:35.59 There must be a con like me in every prison in America.
0:08:35.79,0:08:37.59 I'm the guy who can get it for you.
0:08:37.79,0:08:40.89 Cigarettes, a bag of reefer, if that's your thing
0:08:41.09,0:08:44.49 bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation.
0:08:44.69,0:08:46.79 Damn near anything within reason.
0:08:46.99,0:08:50.79 Yes, sir! I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.
0:08:53.69,0:08:56.69 So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949
0:08:56.89,0:09:00.39 and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him
0:09:00.59,0:09:02.89 I told him, "No problem."
0:09:44.79,0:09:46.89 Andy came to Shawshank Prison
0:09:47.19,0:09:50.99 in early 1947 for murdering his wife and the fella she was banging.
0:09:51.39,0:09:55.39 On the outside, he'd been vice president of a large Portland bank.
0:09:55.89,0:09:57.69 Good work for a man so young.
0:10:40.89,0:10:42.69 You speak English, butt-steak?
0:10:42.89,0:10:44.79 You follow this officer.
0:10:57.49,0:11:01.79 I never seen such a sorry-Iooking heap of maggot shit in all my life.
0:11:01.99,0:11:04.59 Hey, fish! Come over here!
0:11:27.89,0:11:29.29 Taking bets today, Red?
0:11:29.59,0:11:31.29 Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.
0:11:31.49,0:11:33.19 Smokes. Put me down for two.
0:11:33.79,0:11:35.29 All right, who's your horse?
0:11:35.49,0:11:37.29 That little sack of shit.
0:11:38.89,0:11:42.19 Eighth. He'll be first. Bullshit! I'll take that action.
0:11:42.39,0:11:44.59 You're out some smokes, son.
0:11:44.79,0:11:46.59 If you're so smart, you call it.
0:11:46.79,0:11:49.89 I'll take that chubby fat-ass there.
0:11:50.09,0:11:52.69 The fifth one. Put me down for a quarter deck.
0:11:55.89,0:11:57.59 Fresh fish today!
0:11:58.29,0:11:59.79 We're reeling them in!
0:12:00.49,0:12:04.09 I admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him.
0:12:04.69,0:12:07.59 Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.
0:12:07.89,0:12:09.99 That was my first impression of the man.
0:12:10.19,0:12:11.69 What do you say?
0:12:11.89,0:12:15.19 That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass.
0:12:15.39,0:12:17.49 That guy? Never happen.
0:12:17.69,0:12:19.99 10 cigarettes. That's a rich bet.
0:12:20.19,0:12:22.29 Who's going to prove me wrong?
0:12:22.49,0:12:24.29 Heywood? Jigger?
0:12:24.59,0:12:25.89 Skeets?
0:12:26.09,0:12:27.39 Floyd!
0:12:28.29,0:12:30.39 Four brave souls.
0:12:30.59,0:12:33.39 Return to your cellblocks for evening count.
0:12:33.59,0:12:36.89 All prisoners, return to your cellblocks.
0:12:57.29,0:12:58.39 Turn to the right!
0:12:58.59,0:12:59.89 Eyes front.
0:13:12.99,0:13:15.59 This is Mr. Hadley. He's captain of the guards.
0:13:15.79,0:13:17.89 I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.
0:13:18.09,0:13:20.29 You are convicted felons.
0:13:20.59,0:13:22.59 That's why they've sent you to me.
0:13:23.19,0:13:24.59 Rule number one:
0:13:24.79,0:13:26.19 No blasphemy.
0:13:26.79,0:13:30.19 I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain in my prison.
0:13:30.39,0:13:31.59 The other rules
0:13:31.79,0:13:35.09 you'll figure out as you go along. Any questions?
0:13:35.49,0:13:36.49 When do we eat?
0:13:45.19,0:13:47.19 You eat when we say you eat.
0:13:47.39,0:13:50.69 You shit when we say you shit, and piss when we say you piss.
0:13:50.89,0:13:53.69 You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?
0:13:55.59,0:13:56.99 On your feet.
0:13:57.19,0:13:58.99 I believe in two things:
0:13:59.19,0:14:01.59 Discipline and the Bible.
0:14:02.09,0:14:04.19 Here, you'll receive both.
0:14:04.99,0:14:07.09 Put your trust in the Lord.
0:14:07.69,0:14:09.99 Your ass belongs to me.
0:14:11.79,0:14:13.69 Welcome to Shawshank.
0:14:18.89,0:14:20.19 Unhook them.
0:14:25.69,0:14:26.99 Turn around.
0:14:33.89,0:14:35.29 That's enough.
0:14:36.19,0:14:38.19 Move to the end of the cage.
0:14:39.19,0:14:41.79 Turn around. Delouse him.
0:14:43.89,0:14:45.19 Turn around.
0:14:47.99,0:14:50.69 Move out of the cage. Pick up your clothes and Bible.
0:14:50.89,0:14:52.19 Next man up!
0:14:54.49,0:14:55.99 To the right.
0:14:56.19,0:14:57.19 Right. Right.
0:14:57.79,0:14:58.99 Left.
0:14:59.49,0:15:03.29 The first night's the toughest. No doubt about it.
0:15:03.69,0:15:06.79 They march you in naked as the day you were born
0:15:06.99,0:15:10.79 skin burning and half-blind from that delousing shit.
0:15:11.49,0:15:13.89 And when they put you in that cell
0:15:14.09,0:15:16.39 and those bars slam home
0:15:16.89,0:15:19.09 that's when you know it's for real.
0:15:19.69,0:15:22.69 Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.
0:15:23.19,0:15:27.19 Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.
0:15:28.39,0:15:31.79 Most new fish come close to madness the first night.
0:15:32.09,0:15:35.09 Somebody always breaks down crying.
0:15:35.59,0:15:37.19 Happens every time.
0:15:38.09,0:15:39.89 The only question is
0:15:40.09,0:15:41.89 who's it going to be?
0:15:43.29,0:15:46.19 It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.
0:15:47.29,0:15:49.99 I had my money on Andy Dufresne.
0:15:58.99,0:16:00.59 Lights out!
0:16:21.19,0:16:23.49 I remember my first night.
0:16:24.29,0:16:27.29 Seems like a long time ago.
0:16:30.49,0:16:32.09 Hey, fish.
0:16:33.09,0:16:34.89 Fish, fish.
0:16:36.49,0:16:38.29 What are you, scared of the dark?
0:16:40.59,0:16:43.29 Bet you wish your daddy never dicked your mama!
0:16:43.49,0:16:46.99 Piggy! Pork! I want me a pork chop.
0:16:55.29,0:16:58.49 The boys always go fishing with first-timers.
0:16:58.89,0:17:01.79 And they don't quit till they reel someone in.
0:17:03.19,0:17:04.79 Hey, Fat Ass.
0:17:06.29,0:17:07.59 Fat Ass!
0:17:08.79,0:17:10.49 Talk to me, boy.
0:17:11.49,0:17:13.89 I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.
0:17:14.19,0:17:17.09 Don't you listen to these nitwits, you hear me?
0:17:17.29,0:17:19.19 This place ain't so bad.
0:17:19.69,0:17:20.89 Tell you what
0:17:22.19,0:17:25.29 I'll introduce you around, make you feel right at home.
0:17:25.79,0:17:28.79 I know a couple of big old bull queers that'd just
0:17:29.09,0:17:30.99 Iove to make your acquaintance.
0:17:31.19,0:17:34.69 Especially that big, white, mushy butt of yours.
0:17:34.89,0:17:35.99 God!
0:17:36.69,0:17:38.09 I don't belong here!
0:17:38.29,0:17:41.09 We have a winner! I want to go home!
0:17:41.39,0:17:43.99 And it's Fat Ass by a nose!
0:17:46.89,0:17:48.59 Fresh fish!
0:17:54.69,0:17:56.49 I want to go home!
0:17:57.49,0:17:58.69 I want my mother!
0:17:58.99,0:18:01.19 I had your mother! She wasn't that great!
0:18:05.49,0:18:07.49 What the Christ is this horseshit?
0:18:07.69,0:18:09.79 He blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.
0:18:09.99,0:18:12.39 You'll tell him with my baton up your ass!
0:18:12.59,0:18:13.49 Let me out!
0:18:13.69,0:18:17.09 What is your malfunction, you fat barrel of monkey spunk?
0:18:17.29,0:18:20.29 Please! I ain't supposed to be here.
0:18:20.79,0:18:21.79 Not me!
0:18:22.09,0:18:24.39 I won't count to three. Not even to one.
0:18:24.59,0:18:26.59 You shut up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!
0:18:27.09,0:18:29.89 Shut up, man. Shut up!
0:18:30.59,0:18:33.29 You don't understand. I'm not supposed to be here.
0:18:33.49,0:18:34.79 Open that cell.
0:18:34.99,0:18:38.19 Me neither! They run this place like a fucking prison!
0:18:46.09,0:18:47.69 Son of a bitch!
0:18:52.69,0:18:54.99 Captain, take it easy!
0:19:17.39,0:19:20.59 If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here tonight
0:19:20.79,0:19:24.29 I swear by God and Jesus, you will all visit the infirmary.
0:19:24.79,0:19:27.09 Every last motherfucker in here.
0:19:30.49,0:19:34.19 Call the trustees. Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.
0:19:48.49,0:19:53.19 His first night in the joint, Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.
0:19:53.39,0:19:56.39 He never made a sound.
0:20:11.69,0:20:14.09 Tier 3 north, clear count!
0:20:14.99,0:20:16.79 Tier 2 north, clear count.
0:20:17.29,0:20:19.69 Tier 3 south, clear.
0:20:24.49,0:20:26.09 Prepare to roll out.
0:20:29.69,0:20:31.19 Roll out!
0:21:25.09,0:21:27.29 Are you going to eat that?
0:21:27.89,0:21:30.19 I hadn't planned on it.
0:21:31.29,0:21:32.49 Do you mind?
0:21:41.09,0:21:42.49 That's nice and ripe.
0:21:54.19,0:21:56.29 Jake says thank you.
0:21:56.79,0:21:59.99 Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.
0:22:01.39,0:22:04.79 I'm going to look after him until he's big enough to fly.
0:22:06.19,0:22:07.69 Oh, no! Here he comes.
0:22:10.99,0:22:12.49 Morning, fellas.
0:22:12.69,0:22:14.69 Fine morning, isn't it?
0:22:14.99,0:22:17.19 You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?
0:22:17.49,0:22:19.69 Send them down. I want them lined up
0:22:19.99,0:22:22.59 just like a pretty little chorus line.
0:22:23.69,0:22:24.89 Look at that.
0:22:25.39,0:22:28.59 I can't stand this guy. Oh, Lord!
0:22:29.19,0:22:31.69 Yes! Richmond, Virginia.
0:22:31.89,0:22:33.29 Smell my ass!
0:22:33.49,0:22:35.49 After he smells mine.
0:22:35.89,0:22:39.59 That's a shame about your horse coming in last and all.
0:22:39.79,0:22:42.59 But I sure do love that winning horse of mine, though.
0:22:42.79,0:22:45.39 I owe that boy a big kiss when I see him.
0:22:45.99,0:22:49.99 Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!
0:22:50.49,0:22:52.09 Hey, Tyrell.
0:22:52.39,0:22:54.39 You pull infirmary duty this week?
0:22:55.39,0:22:56.99 How's my horse doing anyway?
0:22:57.39,0:22:58.49 Dead.
0:22:59.29,0:23:01.49 Hadley busted his head up pretty good.
0:23:01.69,0:23:03.89 Doc had gone home for the night.
0:23:04.39,0:23:06.69 Poor bastard lay there till this morning.
0:23:06.89,0:23:09.39 By then, there wasn't nothing we could do.
0:23:15.69,0:23:16.99 What was his name?
0:23:20.39,0:23:21.59 What'd you say?
0:23:23.49,0:23:25.89 I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.
0:23:26.59,0:23:29.39 What the fuck do you care, new fish?
0:23:30.39,0:23:33.49 Doesn't fucking matter what his name was. He's dead.
0:23:55.59,0:23:57.49 Anybody come at you yet?
0:23:59.69,0:24:01.49 Anybody get to you yet?
0:24:03.19,0:24:05.69 Hey, we all need friends in here.
0:24:05.99,0:24:07.69 I could be a friend to you.
0:24:16.89,0:24:18.29 Hard to get.
0:24:20.39,0:24:21.89 I like that.
0:24:28.89,0:24:32.09 Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.
0:24:32.39,0:24:34.39 I guess he had a lot on his mind
0:24:34.79,0:24:37.69 trying to adapt to life on the inside.
0:24:38.39,0:24:41.59 Wasn't until a month went by before he opened his mouth
0:24:41.79,0:24:44.19 to say more than two words to somebody.
0:24:45.39,0:24:46.89 As it turned out
0:24:47.39,0:24:49.29 that somebody was me.
0:24:57.99,0:24:59.79 I'm Andy Dufresne.
0:25:01.09,0:25:02.79 Wife-killing banker.
0:25:04.99,0:25:06.39 Why'd you do it?
0:25:06.79,0:25:08.79 I didn't, since you ask.
0:25:09.49,0:25:11.29 You're going to fit right in.
0:25:11.49,0:25:14.19 Everybody in here's innocent. Didn't you know that?
0:25:14.79,0:25:17.99 What you in here for? Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.
0:25:21.09,0:25:23.59 Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.
0:25:23.79,0:25:27.39 You think your shit smells sweeter than most. Is that right?
0:25:27.59,0:25:29.09 What do you think?
0:25:29.49,0:25:32.49 To tell you the truth, I haven't made up my mind.
0:25:33.69,0:25:36.49 I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.
0:25:37.49,0:25:40.79 I'm known to locate certain things from time to time.
0:25:40.99,0:25:43.49 I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.
0:25:44.19,0:25:45.49 A rock hammer.
0:25:45.89,0:25:48.59 What is it and why? What do you care?
0:25:49.89,0:25:52.59 For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask. I'd quote a price.
0:25:52.79,0:25:55.29 But a toothbrush is a non-lethal object, isn't it?
0:25:56.79,0:25:58.19 Fair enough.
0:25:58.69,0:26:01.29 A rock hammer is about six or seven inches long.
0:26:01.49,0:26:03.79 Looks like a miniature pickax. Pickax?
0:26:03.99,0:26:05.19 For rocks.
0:26:07.89,0:26:09.09 Quartz?
0:26:12.99,0:26:16.49 And some mica, shale
0:26:17.69,0:26:18.99 limestone.
0:26:19.19,0:26:20.39 So?
0:26:21.29,0:26:23.09 So I'm a rock hound.
0:26:23.59,0:26:26.69 At least I was in my old life. I'd like to be again.
0:26:26.89,0:26:30.09 Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy into somebody's skull.
0:26:31.49,0:26:33.09 No, I have no enemies here.
0:26:33.29,0:26:35.59 No? Wait a while.
0:26:37.19,0:26:38.79 Word gets around.
0:26:39.49,0:26:41.99 The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.
0:26:43.39,0:26:45.19 Especially Bogs.
0:26:46.19,0:26:49.59 Don't suppose it would help if I told them I'm not homosexual.
0:26:49.79,0:26:51.29 Neither are they.
0:26:51.49,0:26:54.89 You have to be human first. They don't qualify.
0:26:59.39,0:27:03.79 Bull queers take by force. That's all they want or understand.
0:27:03.99,0:27:07.59 If I were you, I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.
0:27:07.79,0:27:10.49 Thanks for the advice. Well, that's free.
0:27:10.89,0:27:12.79 You understand my concern.
0:27:12.99,0:27:15.59 If there's trouble, I won't use the rock hammer.
0:27:16.59,0:27:20.59 Then I'd guess you want to escape. Tunnel under the wall, maybe.
0:27:21.49,0:27:23.19 What did I miss? What's so funny?
0:27:23.59,0:27:26.29 You'll understand when you see the rock hammer.
0:27:28.09,0:27:30.39 What's an item like this usually go for?
0:27:30.59,0:27:33.09 Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.
0:27:33.59,0:27:35.99 My normal markup's 20 percent.
0:27:36.19,0:27:38.59 But this is a specialty item.
0:27:38.79,0:27:43.29 Risk goes up, price goes up. Let's make it an even 10 bucks.
0:27:43.49,0:27:44.79 Ten it is.
0:27:46.59,0:27:48.59 Waste of money, if you ask me.
0:27:48.89,0:27:50.09 Why's that?
0:27:51.59,0:27:54.59 Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.
0:27:56.19,0:27:58.19 They find it, you're going to lose it.
0:27:58.39,0:28:00.49 If they catch you, you don't know me.
0:28:00.69,0:28:02.89 Mention my name, we never do business again.
0:28:03.39,0:28:06.49 Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum. Now you got that?
0:28:07.29,0:28:08.89 I understand.
0:28:10.09,0:28:12.19 Thank you, Mr...?
0:28:12.39,0:28:13.39 Red.
0:28:14.19,0:28:15.49 Name's Red.
0:28:16.89,0:28:18.49 Why do they call you that?
0:28:22.29,0:28:24.29 Maybe it's because I'm Irish.
0:28:32.49,0:28:35.39 I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby.
0:28:36.19,0:28:38.69 He had a quiet way about him
0:28:38.99,0:28:42.99 a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.
0:28:43.49,0:28:44.99 He strolled
0:28:45.19,0:28:49.19 like a man in the park without a care or a worry in the world.
0:28:49.59,0:28:54.19 Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.
0:28:56.19,0:28:58.39 I think it'd be fair to say
0:28:58.69,0:29:00.89 I liked Andy from the start.
0:29:02.49,0:29:06.29 Let's go! Some of us got a schedule to keep.
0:29:09.59,0:29:12.09 Move it! Come on, move it!
0:29:14.69,0:29:17.59 How you doing? How's the wife treating you?
0:29:55.79,0:29:57.19 Andy was right.
0:29:57.49,0:29:59.69 I finally got the joke.
0:29:59.99,0:30:02.39 It would take a man about 600 years
0:30:02.59,0:30:05.09 to tunnel under the wall with one of these.
0:30:08.89,0:30:11.29 - Book? - Not today.
0:30:17.29,0:30:18.29 Book?
0:30:25.69,0:30:27.79 Delivery for Dufresne.
0:30:45.49,0:30:47.09 Here's your book.
0:30:52.09,0:30:53.39 Thanks.
0:30:59.59,0:31:03.29 We're running low on hexite. Get on back and fetch us up some.
0:31:40.69,0:31:42.19 This will blind you.
0:31:42.59,0:31:44.99 Honey, hush.
0:31:57.49,0:31:59.49 That's it. You fight!
0:31:59.69,0:32:01.19 Better that way.
0:32:09.39,0:32:12.49 I wish I could tell you Andy fought the good fight
0:32:12.69,0:32:14.69 and the Sisters let him be.
0:32:15.29,0:32:17.09 I wish I could tell you that
0:32:17.29,0:32:20.29 but prison is no fairy-tale world.
0:32:21.39,0:32:23.39 He never said who did it.
0:32:23.59,0:32:25.19 But we all knew.
0:32:30.09,0:32:32.59 Things went on like that for a while.
0:32:32.99,0:32:35.49 Prison life consists of routine
0:32:35.69,0:32:37.69 and then more routine.
0:32:40.19,0:32:43.69 Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises.
0:32:45.19,0:32:46.99 The Sisters kept at him.
0:32:47.29,0:32:49.29 Sometimes he was able to fight them off.
0:32:49.59,0:32:50.99 Sometimes not.
0:32:52.19,0:32:54.39 And that's how it went for Andy.
0:32:54.99,0:32:56.69 That was his routine.
0:32:57.59,0:33:00.99 I do believe those first two years were the worst for him.
0:33:01.49,0:33:04.89 And I also believe that if things had gone on that way
0:33:05.19,0:33:07.59 this place would have got the best of him.
0:33:08.39,0:33:11.19 But then, in the spring of 1949
0:33:11.39,0:33:13.29 the powers that be decided:
0:33:13.49,0:33:16.79 The roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing.
0:33:16.99,0:33:20.19 I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.
0:33:20.99,0:33:22.39 As you know
0:33:23.19,0:33:26.69 special detail carries with it special privileges.
0:33:26.89,0:33:29.29 It was outdoor detail
0:33:29.69,0:33:33.99 and May is one damned fine month to be working outdoors.
0:33:34.19,0:33:35.59 Stay in line there.
0:33:35.79,0:33:38.89 More than a hundred men volunteered for the job.
0:33:43.19,0:33:46.19 Wallace E. Unger.
0:33:46.69,0:33:49.09 Ellis Redding.
0:33:49.29,0:33:50.79 Wouldn't you know it?
0:33:51.29,0:33:54.59 Me and some fellows I know were among the names called.
0:33:54.79,0:33:56.79 Andrew Dufresne.
0:33:57.19,0:34:00.09 It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.
0:34:00.59,0:34:03.09 I made my usual 20 percent, of course.
0:34:03.29,0:34:06.79 So this big-shot lawyer calls me long-distance from Texas.
0:34:06.99,0:34:08.49 I say, "Yeah?"
0:34:08.79,0:34:12.39 He says, " Sorry to inform you, but your brother just died."
0:34:12.59,0:34:16.49 - I'm sorry to hear that. - I'm not. He was an asshole.
0:34:16.69,0:34:18.89 Ran off years ago. Figured him for dead.
0:34:19.09,0:34:21.39 So this lawyer fellow says to me:
0:34:21.59,0:34:25.59 "He died a rich man." Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.
0:34:26.39,0:34:28.29 A million bucks?
0:34:28.59,0:34:33.09 - Incredible how lucky some assholes get. - You going to see any of that?
0:34:33.69,0:34:36.49 Thirty-five thousand. That's what he left me.
0:34:36.69,0:34:37.89 - Dollars? - Yeah
0:34:38.59,0:34:41.59 That's great! That's like winning the sweepstakes.
0:34:41.99,0:34:43.09 Isn't it?
0:34:43.29,0:34:46.19 Dumb shit, what do you think the government will do to me?
0:34:46.39,0:34:48.79 Take a big wet bite out of my ass is what.
0:34:49.59,0:34:50.89 Poor Byron.
0:34:51.79,0:34:54.99 Terrible fucking luck, huh? Crying shame.
0:34:55.19,0:34:57.39 Some people really got it awful.
0:34:57.69,0:34:59.09 Andy, are you nuts?
0:34:59.29,0:35:01.19 Keep your eyes on your mop, man!
0:35:01.39,0:35:04.39 You'll pay some tax, but you'll still end up
0:35:04.59,0:35:07.39 Yeah, maybe enough to buy a new car, and then what?
0:35:07.59,0:35:10.29 I got to pay tax on the car. Repair, maintenance
0:35:10.35,0:35:13.69 kids pestering you to take them for a ride all the time.
0:35:13.89,0:35:17.59 Then if you figure your tax wrong, you pay out of your own pocket.
0:35:17.79,0:35:19.89 I tell you! Uncle Sam!
0:35:20.19,0:35:24.19 He puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple.
0:35:26.79,0:35:28.99 Getting himself killed. Keep tarring.
0:35:29.19,0:35:31.69 Some brother. Shit!
0:35:36.69,0:35:38.09 Mr. Hadley
0:35:38.99,0:35:40.29 do you trust your wife?
0:35:41.99,0:35:43.39 Oh, that's funny.
0:35:43.99,0:35:46.59 You'll look funnier sucking my dick with no teeth.
0:35:46.79,0:35:50.09 What I mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back?
0:35:51.29,0:35:54.59 Step aside, Mert. This fucker's having himself an accident.
0:35:54.89,0:35:55.89 He'll push him off!
0:35:56.09,0:35:57.99 If you trust her, you can keep
0:35:58.19,0:35:59.59 that 35,000.
0:36:00.29,0:36:03.59 - What did you say? - Thirty-five thousand.
0:36:03.69,0:36:04.69 All of it.
0:36:04.89,0:36:07.99 Every penny. You better start making sense.
0:36:08.19,0:36:10.49 If you want to keep it, give it to your wife.
0:36:10.69,0:36:14.59 The IRS allows a one-time-only gift to your spouse for up to $ 60,000.
0:36:14.79,0:36:17.19 - Bullshit. Tax-free? - Tax-free.
0:36:17.39,0:36:19.39 IRS can't touch one cent.
0:36:19.79,0:36:22.19 You're that smart banker that killed his wife.
0:36:22.49,0:36:25.79 Why should I believe you? So I can end up in here with you?
0:36:25.99,0:36:28.89 It's legal. Ask the IRS. They'll say the same thing.
0:36:29.09,0:36:33.09 I feel stupid telling you this. I'm sure you would have investigated.
0:36:33.29,0:36:36.99 I don't need you to tell me where the bear shit in the buckwheat.
0:36:37.19,0:36:40.59 Of course not. But you do need someone to set it up for you.
0:36:40.79,0:36:42.39 That'll cost you. A lawyer.
0:36:42.59,0:36:44.79 A bunch of ball-washing bastards!
0:36:45.29,0:36:48.79 I suppose I could set it up for you. That would save you some money.
0:36:48.99,0:36:51.09 You get the forms, I'll prepare them
0:36:51.29,0:36:52.99 nearly free of charge.
0:36:54.29,0:36:57.59 I'd only ask three beers apiece for each of my coworkers.
0:36:58.49,0:37:00.09 "Coworkers." That's rich!
0:37:00.89,0:37:03.39 A man working outdoors feels more like a man
0:37:03.59,0:37:07.09 if he can have a bottle of suds. That's only my opinion
0:37:07.49,0:37:08.49 sir.
0:37:12.49,0:37:14.39 What are you jimmies staring at?
0:37:14.59,0:37:16.19 Let's go! Work!
0:37:25.69,0:37:27.69 And that's how it came to pass
0:37:27.89,0:37:30.49 that on the second-to-last day of the job
0:37:30.69,0:37:35.29 the convict crew that tarred the factory roof in the spring of '49
0:37:35.49,0:37:38.59 wound up sitting in a row at 10:00 in the morning
0:37:38.79,0:37:44.29 drinking icy-cold beer, courtesy of the hardest screw
0:37:44.49,0:37:47.79 that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.
0:37:47.99,0:37:50.39 Drink up while it's cold, ladies.
0:37:51.49,0:37:56.09 The colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous.
0:37:57.19,0:38:01.69 We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men.
0:38:02.09,0:38:05.49 We could have been tarring the roof of one of our own houses.
0:38:05.69,0:38:08.49 We were the lords of all creation.
0:38:09.09,0:38:10.69 As for Andy
0:38:10.89,0:38:13.59 he spent that break hunkered in the shade
0:38:13.79,0:38:16.29 a strange little smile on his face
0:38:16.49,0:38:18.69 watching us drink his beer.
0:38:26.79,0:38:28.19 Want a cold one?
0:38:28.89,0:38:31.79 No, thanks. I gave up drinking.
0:38:35.79,0:38:38.79 You could argue he done it to curry favor with the guards.
0:38:39.49,0:38:43.29 Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.
0:38:44.09,0:38:45.09 Me?
0:38:45.29,0:38:48.09 I think he did it just to feel normal again
0:38:48.59,0:38:50.79 if only for a short while.
0:38:53.39,0:38:54.49 King me.
0:38:56.39,0:38:58.99 Chess. Now there's a game of kings. What?
0:38:59.29,0:39:00.99 Civilized. Strategic.
0:39:01.69,0:39:04.59 And a total fucking mystery. I hate it.
0:39:04.89,0:39:06.69 Let me teach you someday.
0:39:08.29,0:39:09.19 Sure.
0:39:09.69,0:39:11.39 We could get a board together.
0:39:11.69,0:39:14.69 You're talking to the right man. I can get things, right?
0:39:14.89,0:39:18.89 We might do business on a board, and I'll carve the pieces myself.
0:39:19.09,0:39:22.39 One side in alabaster, one in soapstone. What do you think?
0:39:22.99,0:39:24.39 I think it'll take years.
0:39:24.59,0:39:27.19 Years I got. What I don't have are the rocks.
0:39:27.39,0:39:29.39 Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.
0:39:29.59,0:39:31.39 Pebbles, mostly.
0:39:35.69,0:39:38.49 We're getting to be kind of friends, aren't we?
0:39:39.39,0:39:40.99 Yeah, I guess.
0:39:41.59,0:39:43.09 Can I ask you something?
0:39:44.59,0:39:45.99 Why'd you do it?
0:39:47.29,0:39:48.79 I'm innocent, Red.
0:39:48.99,0:39:51.09 Just like everybody else here.
0:39:55.39,0:39:56.99 What are you in for?
0:39:59.69,0:40:01.79 Murder. Same as you.
0:40:02.09,0:40:03.19 Innocent?
0:40:05.89,0:40:08.29 Only guilty man in Shawshank.
0:41:07.69,0:41:09.09 Where's the canary?
0:41:09.39,0:41:10.59 How did you know?
0:41:10.89,0:41:13.19 How did I know what? So you don't know.
0:41:13.39,0:41:14.49 Come.
0:41:16.99,0:41:19.09 This is where the canary is.
0:41:21.79,0:41:25.09 Quite a surprise to hear a woman singing in my house, eh?
0:41:28.59,0:41:29.99 That's quite a
0:41:30.99,0:41:32.59 surprise.
0:41:36.89,0:41:38.29 Wait, wait.
0:41:38.89,0:41:40.39 Here she comes.
0:41:40.69,0:41:43.49 I like this part when she does that shit with her hair.
0:41:43.69,0:41:46.39 I know. I've seen it three times this month.
0:41:46.69,0:41:48.59 Gilda, are you decent?
0:41:49.59,0:41:50.69 Me?
0:41:53.39,0:41:55.19 God, I love it.
0:42:00.29,0:42:03.29 I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.
0:42:04.29,0:42:08.09 I'm known to locate certain things from time to time. What do you want?
0:42:08.29,0:42:10.39 Rita Hayworth. What?
0:42:10.99,0:42:12.29 Can you get her?
0:42:13.69,0:42:17.09 So this is Johnny Farrel. I've heard a lot about you.
0:42:18.39,0:42:20.69 Take a few weeks. Weeks?
0:42:20.89,0:42:25.29 I don't have her stuffed down the front of my pants right now, sorry to say.
0:42:25.79,0:42:27.19 But I'll get her.
0:42:27.39,0:42:28.69 Relax.
0:42:30.59,0:42:31.89 Thanks.
0:42:52.49,0:42:54.19 Get out! I got to change reels!
0:42:54.49,0:42:56.39 I said fuck off!
0:43:02.59,0:43:03.99 Ain't you going to scream?
0:43:05.29,0:43:07.19 Let's get this over with.
0:43:12.29,0:43:14.29 He broke my fucking nose!
0:43:23.59,0:43:24.79 Now
0:43:25.29,0:43:27.39 I'm going to open my fly
0:43:27.69,0:43:30.49 and you'll swallow what I give you to swallow.
0:43:31.59,0:43:34.19 Then you'll swallow Rooster's. You broke his nose.
0:43:34.39,0:43:36.59 He ought to have something to show for it.
0:43:36.79,0:43:38.59 You put it in my mouth, you lose it.
0:43:38.79,0:43:41.39 No, you don't understand.
0:43:41.79,0:43:44.79 Do that and I'll put all eight inches of this in your ear.
0:43:44.99,0:43:48.49 All right, but you should know that sudden, serious brain injury
0:43:48.69,0:43:50.59 causes the victim to bite down hard.
0:43:50.79,0:43:54.29 In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong
0:43:55.09,0:43:57.59 they have to pry the victim's jaws open
0:43:57.79,0:43:59.19 with a crowbar.
0:44:02.09,0:44:03.59 Where do you get this shit?
0:44:03.89,0:44:05.29 I read it.
0:44:06.69,0:44:09.29 You know how to read, you ignorant fuck?
0:44:10.99,0:44:12.09 Honey!
0:44:13.99,0:44:15.79 You shouldn't!
0:44:18.39,0:44:21.29 Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth.
0:44:21.59,0:44:23.69 And neither did his friends.
0:44:24.09,0:44:27.89 What they did do is beat him within an inch of his life.
0:44:28.59,0:44:31.09 Andy spent a month in the infirmary.
0:44:31.89,0:44:34.39 Bogs spent a week in the hole.
0:44:38.49,0:44:40.09 Time's up, Bogs.
0:44:43.89,0:44:45.49 It's your world, boss.
0:44:48.79,0:44:51.59 Return to your cellblocks for evening count.
0:44:51.79,0:44:54.49 All prisoners report for lock down.
0:45:09.39,0:45:10.39 What?
0:45:23.09,0:45:25.59 Where's he going? Grab his ankles.
0:45:31.39,0:45:32.69 Help!
0:45:36.39,0:45:38.89 Two things never happened again after that.
0:45:39.19,0:45:42.29 The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again.
0:45:43.19,0:45:45.69 And Bogs would never walk again.
0:45:46.89,0:45:50.39 They transferred him to a minimum-security hospital upstate.
0:45:50.59,0:45:53.29 To my knowledge, he lived out the rest of his days
0:45:53.49,0:45:55.39 drinking his food through a straw.
0:45:56.39,0:46:00.39 Andy could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of the infirmary.
0:46:02.19,0:46:03.79 Sounds good to us.
0:46:03.99,0:46:06.49 I figure we owe him that much for the beer.
0:46:07.29,0:46:09.49 The man likes to play chess.
0:46:10.09,0:46:11.99 Let's get him some rocks.
0:46:44.59,0:46:45.79 Guys!
0:46:46.59,0:46:47.59 I got one.
0:46:47.89,0:46:49.29 I got one. Look!
0:46:51.29,0:46:55.29 Heywood, that isn't soapstone! And it ain't alabaster either.
0:46:55.49,0:46:57.59 What are you, a fucking geologist?
0:46:57.59,0:46:59.59 He's right. It ain't.
0:46:59.59,0:47:02.49 - What the hell is it then? - It's a horse apple.
0:47:03.39,0:47:05.99 - Bullshit! - No, horseshit.
0:47:05.99,0:47:07.99 Petrified.
0:47:16.49,0:47:17.99 Damn!
0:47:17.99,0:47:22.49 Despite a few hitches, the boys came through in fine style.
0:47:22.49,0:47:24.39 And by the weekend he was due back
0:47:24.69,0:47:28.39 we had enough rocks saved up to keep him busy till rapture.
0:47:29.19,0:47:31.69 Also got a big shipment in that week.
0:47:31.99,0:47:33.09 Cigarettes
0:47:33.29,0:47:34.29 chewing gum
0:47:34.49,0:47:35.99 sipping whisky
0:47:36.19,0:47:39.59 playing cards with naked ladies on them. You name it.
0:47:39.79,0:47:42.49 And of course, the most important item:
0:47:44.39,0:47:46.49 Rita Hayworth herself.
0:48:23.59,0:48:25.79 Heads up. They're tossing cells.
0:48:26.09,0:48:28.79 Heads up. They're tossing cells!
0:48:29.39,0:48:31.79 119.
0:48:33.69,0:48:35.39 123.
0:48:45.79,0:48:46.59 On your feet.
0:48:49.29,0:48:50.79 Face the wall.
0:49:24.89,0:49:26.79 Turn around and face the warden.
0:49:33.39,0:49:35.49 Pleased to see you reading this.
0:49:36.79,0:49:38.79 Any favorite passages?
0:49:39.59,0:49:41.99 "Watch ye, therefore, for ye know not
0:49:42.19,0:49:44.39 when the master of the house cometh."
0:49:45.59,0:49:47.69 Mark 13:35.
0:49:48.49,0:49:50.29 I've always liked that one.
0:49:51.29,0:49:52.89 But I prefer
0:49:53.39,0:49:55.29 " I am the light of the world.
0:49:55.69,0:49:58.99 Ye that followeth me shall have the light of life."
0:49:59.19,0:50:01.89 John, chapter 8, verse 12.
0:50:02.19,0:50:04.19 I hear you're good with numbers.
0:50:04.39,0:50:05.39 How nice.
0:50:06.59,0:50:08.59 Man should have a skill.
0:50:11.09,0:50:12.09 Explain this.
0:50:13.29,0:50:17.29 It's called a rock blanket. It's for shaping and polishing rocks.
0:50:17.79,0:50:19.69 A little hobby of mine.
0:50:30.59,0:50:31.99 It's pretty clean.
0:50:32.29,0:50:35.39 Some contraband here, but nothing to get in a twist over.
0:50:39.69,0:50:41.69 I can't say I approve of this.
0:50:43.39,0:50:44.79 But I suppose
0:50:46.89,0:50:48.89 exceptions can be made.
0:50:59.29,0:51:00.59 Lock them up!
0:51:03.49,0:51:05.09 I almost forgot.
0:51:05.49,0:51:07.69 I'd hate to deprive you of this.
0:51:08.39,0:51:10.39 Salvation lies within.
0:51:10.59,0:51:11.59 Yes, sir.
0:51:20.19,0:51:22.69 Tossing cells was just an excuse.
0:51:23.19,0:51:24.39 Truth is
0:51:24.59,0:51:27.09 Norton wanted to size Andy up.
0:51:40.79,0:51:43.09 My wife made that in church group.
0:51:45.79,0:51:47.09 Very nice, sir.
0:51:48.69,0:51:50.09 You enjoy working the laundry?
0:51:51.79,0:51:53.49 No, sir. Not especially.
0:51:53.79,0:51:56.29 Perhaps we can find something more
0:51:56.49,0:51:58.99 befitting a man of your education.
0:52:06.99,0:52:08.49 Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?
0:52:10.39,0:52:13.09 I thought I heard you out here.
0:52:13.79,0:52:15.39 I've been reassigned to you.
0:52:15.69,0:52:17.99 I know, they told me.
0:52:18.79,0:52:20.89 Ain't that a kick in the head?
0:52:21.09,0:52:23.39 Well, I'll give you the dime tour.
0:52:23.59,0:52:24.79 Come on.
0:52:26.19,0:52:27.89 Well, here she is.
0:52:28.09,0:52:30.09 The Shawshank Prison Library.
0:52:30.79,0:52:32.79 National Geographics
0:52:33.69,0:52:36.49 Reader's Digest condensed books
0:52:36.69,0:52:38.29 and Louis L'Amour.
0:52:38.79,0:52:40.69 Look magazine.
0:52:40.99,0:52:43.29 Erle Stanley Gardners.
0:52:43.59,0:52:47.09 Every evening I load up the cart and make my rounds.
0:52:47.29,0:52:49.89 I enter the names on this clipboard here.
0:52:50.49,0:52:53.19 Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.
0:52:53.89,0:52:56.79 Any questions? How long have you been librarian?
0:52:57.99,0:53:01.99 I come here in '05, and they made me librarian in 1912.
0:53:03.39,0:53:05.49 And have you ever had an assistant?
0:53:05.79,0:53:08.19 No. Not much to it, really.
0:53:08.99,0:53:10.19 Why me? Why now?
0:53:10.59,0:53:11.89 I don't know.
0:53:12.09,0:53:15.19 But it'd be nice to have some company down here.
0:53:26.39,0:53:28.69 That's him. That's the one.
0:53:36.39,0:53:37.49 I'm Dekins.
0:53:37.89,0:53:39.59 I was thinking
0:53:40.19,0:53:44.09 about setting up some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.
0:53:47.99,0:53:49.49 I see.
0:53:54.59,0:53:57.59 Why don't we have a seat and talk it over.
0:54:00.79,0:54:03.69 Do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?
0:54:15.09,0:54:16.39 Thanks.
0:54:16.99,0:54:18.09 So
0:54:19.89,0:54:21.59 Mister Dekins
0:54:22.39,0:54:24.49 And then Andy says, " Mr. Dekins
0:54:24.69,0:54:27.69 do you want your sons to go to Harvard or Yale?"
0:54:27.89,0:54:28.99 He didn't say that!
0:54:29.39,0:54:31.79 As God as my witness!
0:54:32.09,0:54:33.79 Dekins blinked for a second
0:54:34.09,0:54:37.19 then he laughed and actually shook Andy's hand.
0:54:37.59,0:54:39.89 My ass! Shook his hand.
0:54:40.09,0:54:42.99 I tell you, I near soiled myself!
0:54:43.19,0:54:47.49 All he needed was a suit and tie and a jiggly hula gal on his desk
0:54:47.69,0:54:50.29 he'd have been "Mr. Dufresne," if you please.
0:54:50.49,0:54:52.09 Making a few friends?
0:54:53.39,0:54:55.09 I wouldn't say "friends."
0:54:55.29,0:54:59.09 I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.
0:54:59.29,0:55:01.69 It's a wonderful pet to have.
0:55:01.89,0:55:03.69 Got you out of the laundry, though.
0:55:04.19,0:55:06.09 It might do more than that.
0:55:06.39,0:55:09.09 How about expanding the library. Get some new books.
0:55:09.29,0:55:11.89 If you ask for something, ask for a pool table.
0:55:13.59,0:55:16.59 How do you expect to do that? I mean
0:55:16.79,0:55:19.69 get new books in here, "Mr. Dufresne, if you please."
0:55:20.19,0:55:22.29 I'll ask the warden for funds.
0:55:23.09,0:55:27.39 Six wardens have been through here in my tenure, and I've learned
0:55:27.59,0:55:29.89 one immutable, universal truth:
0:55:30.19,0:55:31.59 Not one born whose asshole
0:55:31.79,0:55:36.69 wouldn't pucker up tighter than a snare drum when you ask for funds.
0:55:37.59,0:55:40.49 - The budget's stretched thin as it is. - I see.
0:55:40.69,0:55:44.09 Maybe I could write the state senate and request funds from them.
0:55:44.29,0:55:48.29 They have only three ways to spend the taxpayers' money for prisons:
0:55:48.59,0:55:51.09 More walls, more bars, more guards.
0:55:51.29,0:55:53.89 I'd like to try, with permission. A letter a week.
0:55:54.09,0:55:56.89 - They can't ignore me forever. - Sure can.
0:55:57.09,0:55:59.79 But you write your letters if it makes you happy.
0:56:00.09,0:56:02.69 I'll even mail them for you. How's that?
0:56:04.39,0:56:07.19 So Andy started writing a letter a week
0:56:07.39,0:56:08.99 just like he said.
0:56:13.19,0:56:15.79 And like Norton said
0:56:15.99,0:56:17.49 Andy got no answers.
0:56:25.69,0:56:30.59 The following April, he did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank.
0:56:31.89,0:56:34.39 Year after that, he did them all
0:56:34.39,0:56:36.29 including the warden's.
0:56:38.09,0:56:41.49 Year after that, they rescheduled the intramural season
0:56:41.79,0:56:44.19 to coincide with tax season.
0:56:45.79,0:56:50.19 The guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their W-2s.
0:56:50.39,0:56:51.79 So Moresby Prison
0:56:51.99,0:56:54.19 issued you a gun, but you paid for it.
0:56:54.49,0:56:56.19 Right. The holster too.
0:56:56.39,0:56:58.79 That's tax-deductible. You can write that off.
0:56:58.99,0:57:02.09 Yes, sir! Andy was a regular cottage industry.
0:57:02.79,0:57:07.29 In fact, it got so busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff.
0:57:07.49,0:57:09.99 Could you hand me a stack of 1040s?
0:57:10.19,0:57:14.99 Got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year, and that was fine by me.
0:57:16.29,0:57:19.39 And still, he kept sending those letters.
0:57:24.89,0:57:27.29 Red、Andy, It's Brooks.
0:57:28.39,0:57:29.89 Watch the door.
0:57:30.09,0:57:31.49 Please, Brooks.
0:57:31.69,0:57:33.49 Calm the fuck down. Stay back!
0:57:33.99,0:57:36.59 - Stay back, goddamn it! - What's going on?
0:57:36.79,0:57:39.39 One second he's fine, then out come the knives.
0:57:39.59,0:57:41.39 We can talk about this, right?
0:57:41.59,0:57:45.39 There's nothing to talk about. I'll cut his fucking throat.
0:57:45.59,0:57:47.39 What's he done to you?
0:57:47.59,0:57:49.19 It's what they done!
0:57:49.79,0:57:50.99 I got no choice.
0:57:51.49,0:57:53.79 You won't hurt Heywood. We all know that.
0:57:53.99,0:57:56.49 - Right, Heywood? - Sure.
0:57:56.69,0:57:59.99 He's a friend of yours, and Brooks is a reasonable man.
0:58:00.29,0:58:01.39 Right, guys?
0:58:02.29,0:58:04.89 So put the knife down. Look at me.
0:58:05.09,0:58:07.29 Put the knife down.
0:58:09.29,0:58:11.39 Look at his neck, for God's sake.
0:58:12.09,0:58:14.39 Look at his neck. He's bleeding.
0:58:15.29,0:58:16.79 It's the only way
0:58:16.99,0:58:19.09 they'd let me stay.
0:58:19.29,0:58:21.69 This is crazy. You don't want to do this.
0:58:21.99,0:58:23.99 Put it, put it down.
0:58:32.79,0:58:34.29 Take it easy.
0:58:34.99,0:58:36.49 You'll be all right.
0:58:37.59,0:58:39.19 Him? What about me?
0:58:39.39,0:58:41.79 Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!
0:58:41.99,0:58:43.89 You've had worse from shaving.
0:58:44.09,0:58:46.19 What did you do to set him off?
0:58:46.39,0:58:48.59 Nothing. I come in here to say farewell.
0:58:49.19,0:58:51.89 Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.
0:58:54.19,0:58:56.99 I just don't understand what happened in there.
0:58:57.19,0:58:59.99 Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse.
0:59:00.19,0:59:02.09 That's enough out of you.
0:59:02.29,0:59:05.09 - Heard he had you shitting your pants. - Fuck you.
0:59:05.29,0:59:06.49 Knock it off.
0:59:07.49,0:59:08.89 Brooks ain't no bug.
0:59:12.79,0:59:14.49 He's just institutionalized.
0:59:15.89,0:59:17.79 "Institutionalized," my ass.
0:59:17.99,0:59:21.99 The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood, 50 years!
0:59:22.19,0:59:23.99 This is all he knows.
0:59:24.19,0:59:26.49 In here, he's an important man
0:59:26.69,0:59:27.79 an educated man.
0:59:28.59,0:59:30.49 Outside, he's nothing.
0:59:31.39,0:59:33.79 Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.
0:59:33.79,0:59:38.09 Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.
0:59:38.39,0:59:40.09 You know what I'm trying to say?
0:59:40.39,0:59:43.29 I do believe you're talking out of your ass.
0:59:44.49,0:59:46.79 You believe whatever you want.
0:59:47.39,0:59:49.79 But I tell you these walls are funny.
0:59:51.39,0:59:52.99 First you hate them.
0:59:54.89,0:59:56.79 Then you get used to them.
0:59:58.69,1:00:00.69 Enough time passes
1:00:01.39,1:00:03.39 you get so you depend on them.
1:00:04.39,1:00:06.59 That's "institutionalized."
1:00:08.29,1:00:11.09 I could never get like that. Oh, yeah?
1:00:11.89,1:00:14.39 Wait till you've been here as long as Brooks.
1:00:14.69,1:00:16.19 Goddamn right.
1:00:18.79,1:00:20.69 They send you here for life
1:00:21.39,1:00:23.69 that's exactly what they take.
1:00:25.49,1:00:27.49 Part that counts, anyway.
1:00:35.09,1:00:37.99 I can't take care of you no more, Jake.
1:00:39.19,1:00:40.79 You go on now.
1:00:42.09,1:00:43.59 You're free.
1:00:44.89,1:00:46.39 You're free.
1:01:05.39,1:01:07.09 Good luck, Brooksie.
1:01:45.09,1:01:46.59 Dear fellas:
1:01:46.89,1:01:50.89 I can't believe how fast things move on the outside.
1:01:52.39,1:01:54.99 Watch it, old-timer! Want to get killed?
1:01:56.29,1:01:59.79 I saw an automobile once when I was a kid
1:02:00.39,1:02:02.79 but now they're everywhere.
1:02:06.49,1:02:10.79 The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry.
1:02:26.59,1:02:30.39 The parole board got me into this halfway house
1:02:30.69,1:02:32.39 called "The Brewer"
1:02:32.59,1:02:33.69 and a job
1:02:33.89,1:02:36.89 bagging groceries at the Food-Way.
1:02:38.39,1:02:40.89 It's hard work and I try to keep up
1:02:41.09,1:02:43.39 but my hands hurt most of the time.
1:02:43.69,1:02:45.69 Make sure your man double-bags.
1:02:45.89,1:02:47.89 Last time, the bottom near came out.
1:02:48.59,1:02:51.59 Make sure you double-bag like the lady says. Understand?
1:02:51.79,1:02:53.09 Yes, sir. Surely will.
1:02:53.29,1:02:56.79 I don't think the store manager likes me very much.
1:02:59.89,1:03:04.19 Sometimes after work, I go to the park and feed the birds.
1:03:04.59,1:03:06.09 I keep thinking
1:03:06.29,1:03:09.69 Jake might just show up and say hello.
1:03:10.29,1:03:12.29 But he never does.
1:03:13.49,1:03:18.29 I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay and making new friends.
1:03:21.99,1:03:24.69 I have trouble sleeping at night.
1:03:24.99,1:03:28.29 I have bad dreams like I'm falling.
1:03:28.49,1:03:30.79 I wake up scared.
1:03:30.99,1:03:34.99 Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am.
1:03:36.69,1:03:41.59 Maybe I should get a gun and rob the Food-Way so they'd send me home.
1:03:41.89,1:03:46.19 I could shoot the manager while I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.
1:03:47.89,1:03:51.89 I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore.
1:03:52.09,1:03:53.89 I don't like it here.
1:03:54.09,1:03:58.09 I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided
1:03:58.89,1:04:00.59 not to stay.
1:04:11.49,1:04:14.09 I doubt they'll kick up any fuss
1:04:14.29,1:04:17.79 not for an old crook like me.
1:05:20.19,1:05:24.49 "I doubt they'll kick up any fuss, not for an old crook like me.
1:05:25.49,1:05:29.39 P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.
1:05:29.59,1:05:31.89 No hard feelings. Brooks."
1:05:42.39,1:05:44.39 He should have died in here.
1:05:49.89,1:05:51.29 What the fuck have you done?
1:05:51.49,1:05:54.19 It's a goddamn mess, I'll tell you that.
1:05:59.69,1:06:03.39 What's all this? You tell me. They're addressed to you.
1:06:04.69,1:06:05.99 Take it.
1:06:14.59,1:06:16.09 "Dear Mr. Dufresne:
1:06:17.19,1:06:19.19 In response to your inquiries
1:06:19.39,1:06:23.69 the state has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project."
1:06:24.39,1:06:26.29 This is $ 200.
1:06:26.49,1:06:30.49 "In addition, the library district has generously responded
1:06:30.69,1:06:33.19 with a donation of used books and sundries.
1:06:33.39,1:06:37.39 We trust this will fill your needs. We now consider the matter closed.
1:06:37.79,1:06:39.59 Please stop sending us letters."
1:06:39.79,1:06:42.49 Clear all this out before the warden gets back.
1:06:42.69,1:06:43.89 Yes, sir.
1:06:48.19,1:06:49.29 Good for you, Andy.
1:06:52.29,1:06:53.39 Wow!
1:06:54.59,1:06:56.59 It only took six years.
1:06:58.09,1:07:00.89 From now on, I'll write two letters a week instead of one.
1:07:01.09,1:07:04.39 I believe you're crazy enough. Get this stuff out
1:07:04.69,1:07:05.49 like he said.
1:07:05.69,1:07:07.09 I've got to pinch a loaf.
1:07:07.29,1:07:08.79 When I come back
1:07:08.99,1:07:10.69 this is all gone, all right?
1:07:51.90,1:07:54.44 Sull'aria...
1:07:59.49,1:08:00.19 Andy, Do you hear that?
1:08:00.61,1:08:04.28 ..zeffiretto
1:08:16.55,1:08:24.34 Questa sera spirerà
1:08:54.79,1:08:59.09 Sotto i pinis
1:08:59.17,1:09:04.34 Del boschetto
1:09:05.89,1:09:08.26 Sotto i pini...
1:09:09.59,1:09:10.79 Dufresne!
1:09:13.29,1:09:14.89 Andy, let me out!
1:09:21.69,1:09:26.69 I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about.
1:09:26.99,1:09:29.19 Truth is, I don't want to know.
1:09:29.39,1:09:31.89 Some things are best left unsaid.
1:09:35.49,1:09:38.19 I like to think it was something so beautiful
1:09:38.39,1:09:40.59 it can't be expressed in words
1:09:40.79,1:09:43.69 and makes your heart ache because of it.
1:09:45.29,1:09:47.79 I tell you, those voices soared
1:09:48.09,1:09:52.39 higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream.
1:09:52.59,1:09:55.99 It was like a beautiful bird flapped into our drab cage
1:09:56.19,1:09:58.89 and made those walls dissolve away.
1:09:59.39,1:10:01.59 And for the briefest of moments
1:10:01.79,1:10:04.79 every last man at Shawshank felt free.
1:10:07.39,1:10:09.99 It pissed the warden off something awful.
1:10:11.29,1:10:12.29 Open the door.
1:10:15.19,1:10:16.99 Open it up!
1:10:18.29,1:10:20.99 Dufresne, open this door!
1:10:22.39,1:10:23.59 Turn that off!
1:10:30.59,1:10:33.09 I am warning you. Turn that off!
1:10:50.79,1:10:52.39 You're mine now.
1:10:59.79,1:11:02.99 Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt.
1:11:03.19,1:11:04.79 On your feet.
1:11:05.99,1:11:08.39 - Hey, look who's here. - Maestro!
1:11:10.19,1:11:13.79 You couldn't play something good, huh? Like Hank Williams?
1:11:14.19,1:11:16.99 They broke the door down before I could take requests.
1:11:17.19,1:11:20.29 - Was it worth two weeks? - Easiest time I ever did.
1:11:20.49,1:11:24.49 No such thing as easy time in the hole. A week in the hole is like a year.
1:11:24.89,1:11:28.19 Damn straight. I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.
1:11:28.39,1:11:31.39 So they let you tote that record player down there, huh?
1:11:33.79,1:11:35.19 It was in here.
1:11:35.99,1:11:37.29 In here.
1:11:38.39,1:11:40.49 That's the beauty of music. They
1:11:40.69,1:11:42.99 can't get that from you.
1:11:46.59,1:11:48.99 Haven't you ever felt that way about music?
1:11:50.79,1:11:53.89 Well, I played a mean harmonica as a younger man.
1:11:54.89,1:11:56.29 Lost interest in it, though.
1:11:56.29,1:11:58.19 Didn't make much sense in here.
1:11:58.19,1:12:00.59 Here's where it makes the most sense.
1:12:00.59,1:12:03.09 You need it so you don't forget.
1:12:03.09,1:12:04.59 Forget?
1:12:04.59,1:12:07.79 Forget that there are...
1:12:07.79,1:12:10.19 places
1:12:10.69,1:12:14.59 in the world that aren't made out of stone.
1:12:15.59,1:12:17.09 There's something
1:12:17.39,1:12:19.09 inside
1:12:19.09,1:12:21.29 that they can't get to
1:12:21.29,1:12:22.59 that they can't touch.
1:12:23.19,1:12:24.59 That's yours.
1:12:26.09,1:12:27.69 What are you talking about?
1:12:28.79,1:12:29.99 Hope.
1:12:31.09,1:12:32.39 Hope.
1:12:34.29,1:12:36.29 Let me tell you something, my friend.
1:12:37.09,1:12:39.39 Hope is a dangerous thing.
1:12:40.59,1:12:42.89 Hope can drive a man insane.
1:12:43.69,1:12:45.79 It's got no use on the inside.
1:12:45.99,1:12:48.19 You'd better get used to that idea.
1:12:50.69,1:12:52.19 Like Brooks did?
1:13:17.59,1:13:18.59 Sit down.
1:13:23.89,1:13:27.19 Says here that you've served 30 years of a life sentence.
1:13:28.39,1:13:30.39 You feel you've been rehabilitated?
1:13:30.69,1:13:31.89 Oh, yes, sir.
1:13:33.19,1:13:34.49 Without a doubt.
1:13:35.69,1:13:38.09 I can honestly say I'm a changed man.
1:13:40.09,1:13:41.99 No danger to society here.
1:13:42.49,1:13:44.09 God's honest truth.
1:13:46.59,1:13:48.69 Absolutely rehabilitated.
1:13:58.69,1:13:59.99 Thirty years.
1:14:01.99,1:14:03.89 Jesus, when you say it like that
1:14:04.79,1:14:06.59 You wonder where it went.
1:14:08.99,1:14:11.19 I wonder where 10 years went.
1:14:16.19,1:14:17.19 Here.
1:14:17.59,1:14:20.39 A little parole rejection present.
1:14:21.59,1:14:23.29 Go ahead and open it.
1:14:24.39,1:14:26.49 Went through one of your competitors.
1:14:26.69,1:14:29.79 I hope you don't mind. I wanted it to be a surprise.
1:14:39.89,1:14:41.29 It's very pretty.
1:14:43.09,1:14:44.29 Thank you.
1:14:46.79,1:14:48.29 You going to play it?
1:14:52.89,1:14:54.09 No.
1:14:57.69,1:14:59.09 Not right now.
1:15:16.79,1:15:17.89 Roll in!
1:15:54.09,1:15:55.39 Lights out!
1:16:29.99,1:16:32.09 Andy was as good as his word.
1:16:32.49,1:16:35.19 He wrote two letters a week instead of one.
1:16:37.29,1:16:41.29 In 1959, the state senate finally clued in to the fact
1:16:41.59,1:16:44.79 they couldn't buy him off with just a $ 200 check.
1:16:44.99,1:16:49.29 Appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of $500
1:16:49.49,1:16:51.39 just to shut him up.
1:16:51.59,1:16:54.59 And you'd be amazed how far Andy could stretch it.
1:16:54.79,1:16:57.69 He made deals with book clubs, charity groups.
1:16:57.89,1:17:00.69 He bought remaindered books by the pound
1:17:01.19,1:17:02.69 Treasure Island.
1:17:03.29,1:17:04.59 Robert Louis
1:17:04.79,1:17:05.79 Stevenson.
1:17:05.99,1:17:07.39 Fiction, adventure.
1:17:09.99,1:17:10.99 What's next?
1:17:11.19,1:17:14.29 I got here Auto Repair
1:17:14.99,1:17:16.19 and Soap Carving.
1:17:16.39,1:17:19.59 Trade skills and hobbies. Under "Educational," behind you.
1:17:19.79,1:17:21.69 Count of Monte Crisco.
1:17:22.19,1:17:24.49 That's "Cristo," you dumb shit.
1:17:25.59,1:17:26.49 By Alexandree
1:17:26.99,1:17:28.29 Dumas
1:17:28.59,1:17:29.69 Dumb ass.
1:17:31.99,1:17:32.99 Dumb ass?
1:17:35.89,1:17:37.89 Dumas. Know what that's about?
1:17:40.19,1:17:42.09 You'd like it. It's about a prison break.
1:17:42.29,1:17:46.19 We ought to file that under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?
1:17:47.09,1:17:51.09 The rest of us did our best to pitch in when and where we could.
1:17:51.79,1:17:53.49 By the year Kennedy was shot
1:17:53.79,1:17:58.29 Andy had transformed a storage room smelling of turpentine
1:17:58.59,1:18:01.69 into the best prison library in New England
1:18:02.39,1:18:05.09 complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.
1:18:05.18,1:18:09.35 Lord, I don't know what I'll do...
1:18:09.43,1:18:12.18 All I do is sit and sigh...
1:18:12.69,1:18:14.59 That was also when Warden Norton
1:18:14.79,1:18:17.79 instituted his famous "Inside Out" program.
1:18:18.19,1:18:20.29 You may remember reading about it.
1:18:20.49,1:18:23.59 It made the papers and got his picture in Look magazine.
1:18:23.79,1:18:25.09 It's no free ride
1:18:25.39,1:18:28.59 but rather a genuine progressive advance
1:18:28.79,1:18:31.29 in corrections and rehabilitation.
1:18:31.59,1:18:34.09 Our inmates, properly supervised
1:18:34.39,1:18:36.99 will be put to work outside these walls
1:18:37.19,1:18:40.49 performing all manner of public service.
1:18:40.49,1:18:42.99 These men can learn the value of an honest day's labor
1:18:42.99,1:18:46.99 and provide a service to the community
1:18:46.99,1:18:52.19 at a bare minimum of expense to Mr. And Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.
1:18:52.59,1:18:54.89 Of course he didn't tell the press
1:18:55.09,1:18:58.59 that "bare minimum of expense" is a fairly loose term.
1:18:58.79,1:19:01.79 There are 100 different ways to skim off the top.
1:19:02.09,1:19:04.49 Men, materials, you name it.
1:19:04.89,1:19:07.79 And oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in!
1:19:07.99,1:19:10.49 At this rate, you'll put me out of business.
1:19:10.69,1:19:15.19 With this pool of slave labor, you can underbid any contractor in town.
1:19:15.69,1:19:18.69 We're providing a valuable community service.
1:19:18.89,1:19:22.59 That's fine for the papers, but I've got a family to feed.
1:19:25.19,1:19:26.79 We go back a long way.
1:19:28.09,1:19:32.99 I need this highway contract. I don't get it and I go under. That's a fact.
1:19:33.89,1:19:37.69 You have some of this fine pie my missus made for you.
1:19:37.99,1:19:39.29 You think about that.
1:19:47.59,1:19:50.29 I wouldn't worry too much about this contract.
1:19:50.49,1:19:53.59 I already got my boys committed elsewhere.
1:19:55.49,1:19:58.59 You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.
1:19:59.69,1:20:01.89 And behind every shady deal
1:20:02.19,1:20:04.79 behind every dollar earned
1:20:05.09,1:20:08.19 there was Andy, keeping the books.
1:20:08.59,1:20:09.79 Two deposits.
1:20:10.09,1:20:14.09 Maine National and New England First. Night drops as always, sir.
1:20:44.39,1:20:45.90 Get my stuff to the laundry.
1:20:46.00,1:20:48.79 Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.
1:20:49.19,1:20:52.79 If they over-starch my shirts again, they'll hear from me.
1:20:52.99,1:20:54.29 How do I look?
1:20:55.29,1:20:57.79 - Very nice. - Big charity to-do up Portland way.
1:20:57.99,1:20:59.59 Governor will be there.
1:21:00.99,1:21:02.39 You want the rest of this?
1:21:03.79,1:21:05.69 Woman can't bake worth shit.
1:21:06.89,1:21:08.29 Thank you, sir.
1:21:11.09,1:21:14.29 He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what I hear.
1:21:14.59,1:21:19.39 He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks.
1:21:19.59,1:21:21.99 A river of dirty money running through here.
1:21:22.19,1:21:25.99 Sooner or later, he'll have to explain where it came from.
1:21:26.19,1:21:27.99 That's where I come in.
1:21:28.59,1:21:30.89 I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.
1:21:31.09,1:21:33.89 Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.
1:21:34.19,1:21:37.79 I send it out into the real world, and when it comes back
1:21:37.99,1:21:40.89 - Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh? - Cleaner.
1:21:41.49,1:21:45.09 By the time Norton retires, I'll have made him a millionaire.
1:21:47.49,1:21:49.29 If they ever catch on,
1:21:49.29,1:21:51.29 he'll wind up in here wearing a number himself.
1:21:52.09,1:21:54.79 I thought you had more faith in me than that.
1:21:54.99,1:21:57.99 I know you're good, but all that paper leaves a trail.
1:21:58.19,1:22:01.59 Now anybody gets curious, FBI, IRS
1:22:01.79,1:22:02.79 whatever...
1:22:03.29,1:22:04.59 It'll lead to somebody.
1:22:04.79,1:22:08.59 Sure it is, but not to me, and certainly not to the warden.
1:22:12.99,1:22:13.99 All right, who?
1:22:14.19,1:22:15.79 Randall Stevens.
1:22:16.29,1:22:17.29 Who?
1:22:17.49,1:22:19.49 The "silent" silent partner.
1:22:19.69,1:22:22.69 He's the guilty one, the man with the bank accounts.
1:22:22.99,1:22:25.09 It's where the filtering process starts.
1:22:25.29,1:22:28.19 They trace anything, it'll just lead to him.
1:22:28.79,1:22:29.99 But who is he?
1:22:30.19,1:22:34.19 He's a phantom, an apparition. Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.
1:22:35.29,1:22:36.49 I conjured him...
1:22:36.69,1:22:37.99 out of thin air.
1:22:38.79,1:22:41.59 He doesn't exist, except on paper.
1:22:44.59,1:22:46.99 You can't just make a person up.
1:22:47.19,1:22:50.29 Sure you can, if you know how the system works.
1:22:50.79,1:22:53.59 It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.
1:22:53.99,1:22:56.59 Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate
1:22:56.79,1:22:58.89 driver's license, Social Security.
1:22:59.19,1:23:00.19 You're shitting me.
1:23:00.39,1:23:03.79 If they trace any accounts, they'll wind up chasing
1:23:03.99,1:23:05.69 a figment of my imagination.
1:23:05.89,1:23:07.89 Well, I'll be damned!
1:23:09.29,1:23:10.99 Did I say you were good?
1:23:11.39,1:23:12.99 Shit, you are Rembrandt.
1:23:13.69,1:23:15.49 The funny thing is
1:23:15.69,1:23:19.69 on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow.
1:23:20.19,1:23:22.49 I had to come to prison to be a crook.
1:23:31.39,1:23:32.69 Ever bother you?
1:23:34.09,1:23:37.19 I don't run the scams. I just process the profits.
1:23:37.49,1:23:39.49 A fine line, maybe
1:23:39.99,1:23:42.09 but I also built that library
1:23:42.29,1:23:45.29 and used it to help guys get their high school diploma.
1:23:45.49,1:23:47.79 Why do you think he lets me do all that?
1:23:47.99,1:23:50.19 Keep you happy and doing the laundry.
1:23:50.39,1:23:51.79 Money instead of sheets.
1:23:52.19,1:23:54.79 Well, I work cheap. That's the tradeoff.
1:24:12.09,1:24:14.69 Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 1965
1:24:14.89,1:24:17.19 on a two-year stretch for B and E.
1:24:17.39,1:24:19.69 That's breaking and entering to you.
1:24:19.99,1:24:23.99 Cops caught him sneaking TV sets out the back door of a JC Penney.
1:24:24.69,1:24:25.99 Young punk.
1:24:26.19,1:24:27.79 Mr. Rock 'n' Roll
1:24:27.99,1:24:29.49 cocky as hell.
1:24:29.69,1:24:32.09 Come on, old boys. Moving like molasses!
1:24:32.39,1:24:34.09 Making me look bad.
1:24:34.39,1:24:36.09 We liked him immediately.
1:24:36.39,1:24:40.09 I'm backing out the door and I got the TV like this.
1:24:40.39,1:24:44.09 A big old thing. I couldn't see shit. Then I hear this voice.
1:24:44.69,1:24:46.69 "Freeze, kid, hands in the air."
1:24:46.89,1:24:51.49 I was standing there, holding onto that TV. Finally the voice says:
1:24:51.49,1:24:55.49 "You hear what I said, boy?" I say, " Yes, sir. I did.
1:24:55.49,1:24:59.89 But if I drop this, you get me on destruction of property too."
1:25:03.49,1:25:06.29 You done some stretch in Cashman, right?
1:25:06.29,1:25:10.29 Yeah, that was an easy piece of time, let me tell you.
1:25:10.49,1:25:13.29 Weekend furloughs. Work programs.
1:25:13.89,1:25:14.79 Sounds like you done time all over.
1:25:16.79,1:25:19.39 I've been in and out since I was 13.
1:25:19.39,1:25:21.79 Name it, chances are I've been there.
1:25:21.79,1:25:24.49 Perhaps you should try a new profession.
1:25:25.89,1:25:27.49 What I mean is
1:25:27.79,1:25:31.19 you're not a very good thief. You should try something else.
1:25:31.49,1:25:34.69 Yeah, what the hell you know about it, Capone?
1:25:35.09,1:25:36.69 What are you in for?
1:25:36.99,1:25:37.99 Me?
1:25:40.39,1:25:42.09 A lawyer fucked me.
1:25:45.99,1:25:48.99 Everybody's innocent in here. Don't you know that?
1:25:56.89,1:26:01.29 As it turned out, Tommy had himself a young wife and a new baby girl.
1:26:01.79,1:26:03.99 Maybe he thought of them on the streets
1:26:04.19,1:26:06.69 or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.
1:26:06.99,1:26:08.29 Whatever it was
1:26:08.69,1:26:11.09 something lit a fire under that boy's ass.
1:26:14.99,1:26:17.79 Thought I might try for my high school equivalency.
1:26:17.99,1:26:20.49 Hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.
1:26:21.89,1:26:24.09 I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.
1:26:25.49,1:26:27.99 I ain't no goddamn loser.
1:26:29.79,1:26:31.59 - You mean that? - Yeah.
1:26:33.29,1:26:34.69 You really mean that?
1:26:35.69,1:26:37.09 Yes, sir, I do.
1:26:37.29,1:26:39.29 Good. Because if we do this
1:26:39.49,1:26:43.39 we do it all the way, a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.
1:26:43.69,1:26:45.49 Thing is, see
1:26:46.79,1:26:48.29 I don't read so good.
1:26:49.49,1:26:50.49 "Well."
1:26:52.59,1:26:54.29 You don't read
1:26:54.49,1:26:55.99 so well.
1:26:58.39,1:26:59.89 We'll get to that.
1:27:04.29,1:27:06.49 So Andy took Tommy under his wing.
1:27:06.69,1:27:09.29 Started walking him through his ABC's.
1:27:11.39,1:27:13.59 Tommy took to it pretty well too.
1:27:13.89,1:27:16.69 Boy found brains he never knew he had.
1:27:18.99,1:27:22.49 Before long, Andy started him on his course requirements.
1:27:22.69,1:27:24.29 He really liked the kid.
1:27:24.49,1:27:28.09 Gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shit heap.
1:27:28.59,1:27:30.89 But that wasn't the only reason.
1:27:31.59,1:27:33.79 Prison time is slow time.
1:27:34.19,1:27:36.79 So you do what you can to keep going.
1:27:37.19,1:27:39.19 Some fellas collect stamps.
1:27:39.59,1:27:42.09 Others build matchstick houses.
1:27:42.69,1:27:45.39 Andy built a library.
1:27:45.89,1:27:47.79 Now he needed a new project.
1:27:48.69,1:27:50.19 Tommy was it.
1:27:50.79,1:27:54.79 It was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks.
1:27:55.39,1:27:58.59 The same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.
1:27:59.49,1:28:00.79 In prison
1:28:00.99,1:28:04.79 a man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied.
1:28:05.49,1:28:10.39 By 1966, right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams
1:28:10.59,1:28:12.79 it was lovely Raquel.
1:28:29.39,1:28:30.39 Time.
1:28:36.39,1:28:37.39 Well?
1:28:38.99,1:28:41.19 Well, it's for shit.
1:28:41.69,1:28:44.49 I wasted a whole year of my time with this bullshit.
1:28:44.69,1:28:46.19 It's probably not that bad.
1:28:46.39,1:28:50.39 I didn't get a thing right. It might as well have been in Chinese.
1:28:50.79,1:28:52.59 Let's see how the score comes out.
1:28:52.79,1:28:55.69 I'll tell you how the goddamn score comes out.
1:28:57.69,1:28:58.99 Two points, right there!
1:28:59.19,1:29:00.79 There's your goddamn score!
1:29:01.09,1:29:04.69 Goddamn cats crawling up trees, 5 times 5 is 25
1:29:05.69,1:29:07.29 Fuck this place!
1:29:07.59,1:29:08.69 Fuck it!
1:29:27.79,1:29:29.09 I feel bad.
1:29:29.29,1:29:30.49 I let him down.
1:29:30.69,1:29:32.39 That's crap, kid.
1:29:32.69,1:29:33.99 He's proud of you.
1:29:34.29,1:29:37.19 We're old friends, I know him as good as anybody.
1:29:37.39,1:29:38.89 Smart fellow, ain't he?
1:29:39.19,1:29:42.29 Smart as they come. He was a banker on the outside.
1:29:42.49,1:29:44.69 What's he in here for anyway?
1:29:45.09,1:29:45.99 Murder.
1:29:47.49,1:29:48.89 The hell, you say.
1:29:50.99,1:29:53.29 You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.
1:29:54.59,1:29:57.29 Caught his wife in bed with some golf pro
1:29:57.30,1:29:58.59 Greased them both.
1:30:06.69,1:30:07.69 What?
1:30:08.99,1:30:11.59 About four years ago
1:30:11.89,1:30:15.09 I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.
1:30:15.59,1:30:17.29 I stole a car.
1:30:17.29,1:30:19.79 It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.
1:30:19.89,1:30:22.19 About six months left to go
1:30:22.49,1:30:24.39 I get a new cellmate in.
1:30:25.09,1:30:26.69 Elmo Blatch.
1:30:27.39,1:30:28.69 Big, twitchy fucker.
1:30:29.59,1:30:33.09 Kind of roomie you pray you don't get. You know what I'm saying?
1:30:33.29,1:30:35.99 Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.
1:30:36.29,1:30:38.59 Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.
1:30:38.79,1:30:40.69 Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.
1:30:40.70,1:30:43.69 You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.
1:30:44.79,1:30:49.39 Talked all the time too. That's the other thing. He never shut up.
1:30:49.59,1:30:51.29 Places he'd been in
1:30:51.59,1:30:54.59 jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.
1:30:54.89,1:30:57.09 Even people he killed.
1:30:58.29,1:31:01.09 People who "gave him shit."
1:31:01.69,1:31:03.29 That's how he put it.
1:31:05.89,1:31:07.99 So one night, like a joke
1:31:09.09,1:31:12.59 I say to him, "Elmo, who did you kill?"
1:31:12.79,1:31:13.89 So he says:
1:31:14.09,1:31:18.09 I got me this job one time, busing tables at a country club
1:31:18.79,1:31:22.69 so I could case all these big rich pricks that come in.
1:31:24.79,1:31:26.79 So I pick out this guy
1:31:27.69,1:31:29.19 go in one night
1:31:29.39,1:31:31.19 and do his place.
1:31:32.59,1:31:33.89 He wakes up
1:31:34.69,1:31:36.39 and gives me shit.
1:31:37.49,1:31:39.19 So I killed him.
1:31:40.89,1:31:43.79 Him and this tasty bitch he was with.
1:31:45.19,1:31:47.39 And that's the best part.
1:31:48.09,1:31:50.59 She's fucking this prick, see
1:31:50.79,1:31:53.79 this golf pro, but she's married to some other guy.
1:31:54.49,1:31:56.99 Some hotshot banker.
1:31:58.49,1:32:00.99 And he's the one they pinned it on.
1:32:12.39,1:32:16.29 I have to say that's the most amazing story I ever heard.
1:32:17.59,1:32:20.09 What amazes me most is you'd be taken in by it.
1:32:20.79,1:32:21.79 Sir?
1:32:23.99,1:32:27.59 It's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you.
1:32:28.19,1:32:32.19 He hears your tale of woe and naturally wants to cheer you up.
1:32:32.39,1:32:34.49 He's young, not terribly bright.
1:32:35.09,1:32:38.49 It's not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he put you in.
1:32:38.89,1:32:40.49 Sir, he's telling the truth.
1:32:41.19,1:32:45.19 Let's say for the moment this Blatch does exist.
1:32:45.69,1:32:50.29 You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, " Yes, I did it. I confess.
1:32:50.49,1:32:53.19 By the way, add a life term to my sentence."
1:32:53.39,1:32:56.19 With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.
1:32:56.39,1:32:58.89 That's assuming Blatch is still there.
1:32:59.09,1:33:01.09 Chances are, he'd be released by now.
1:33:01.29,1:33:03.69 They'd have his last known address.
1:33:03.89,1:33:05.89 It's a chance, isn't it?
1:33:08.19,1:33:09.89 How can you be so obtuse?
1:33:10.89,1:33:11.89 What?
1:33:13.39,1:33:14.79 What did you call me?
1:33:14.99,1:33:16.79 Obtuse. Is it deliberate?
1:33:17.09,1:33:18.59 You're forgetting yourself.
1:33:18.99,1:33:21.89 The country club will have his old timecards.
1:33:22.09,1:33:24.89 Records, W-2s with his name on them.
1:33:25.09,1:33:27.79 If you want to indulge this fantasy, it's your business.
1:33:27.99,1:33:30.59 Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.
1:33:30.79,1:33:33.39 If I got out, I'd never mention what happens here.
1:33:33.99,1:33:36.99 I'd be as indictable as you for laundering that money.
1:33:38.89,1:33:41.79 Don't ever mention money to me, you son of a bitch!
1:33:41.99,1:33:43.69 Not in this office
1:33:43.89,1:33:45.79 not anywhere. Get in here, now!
1:33:45.99,1:33:49.09 I just wanted to put you at ease, that's all.
1:33:49.39,1:33:50.59 Solitary. A month.
1:33:51.59,1:33:52.89 What's wrong with you?
1:33:53.09,1:33:54.39 Get him out of here.
1:33:54.59,1:33:56.19 This is my chance to get out!
1:33:56.39,1:33:58.19 It's my life! Understand?!
1:33:58.39,1:34:00.49 Get him out!
1:34:02.29,1:34:04.19 A month in the hole.
1:34:04.39,1:34:07.09 That's the longest stretch I ever heard of.
1:34:07.29,1:34:08.59 It's all my fault.
1:34:08.79,1:34:10.39 Bullshit.
1:34:11.09,1:34:13.79 You didn't pull the trigger or convict him.
1:34:13.99,1:34:16.39 Are you saying Andy is innocent?
1:34:16.59,1:34:18.59 I mean, for real innocent?
1:34:18.79,1:34:20.19 It looks that way.
1:34:20.59,1:34:22.49 Sweet Jesus.
1:34:22.79,1:34:24.59 How long has he been here now?
1:34:24.99,1:34:28.29 1947. What is that? Nineteen years.
1:34:28.49,1:34:31.09 Williams, Thomas. Yeah, over here.
1:34:36.99,1:34:38.09 What you got?
1:34:38.79,1:34:40.09 Board of Education.
1:34:40.29,1:34:41.79 That son of a bitch mailed it.
1:34:41.99,1:34:45.99 You going to open it or stand there with your thumb up your butt?
1:34:46.19,1:34:48.39 Thumb up my butt sounds better.
1:34:48.89,1:34:51.69 Skeets, come on. Give me that, you shithead.
1:34:52.49,1:34:53.89 Floyd, come on.
1:34:59.29,1:35:01.69 Will you throw that away, please?
1:35:07.29,1:35:08.99 Well, shit.
1:35:21.69,1:35:24.49 The kid passed. C + average.
1:35:24.69,1:35:26.79 Thought you'd like to know.
1:35:43.09,1:35:44.49 Warden wants to talk.
1:35:58.29,1:35:59.29 Out here?
1:35:59.49,1:36:01.79 That's what the man said.
1:36:17.89,1:36:18.89 Warden?
1:36:28.89,1:36:32.89 I'm asking you to keep this conversation just between us.
1:36:34.49,1:36:36.69 I feel awkward enough as it is.
1:36:55.19,1:36:57.29 We got a situation here.
1:36:58.09,1:37:00.19 I think you can appreciate that.
1:37:00.39,1:37:01.69 Yes, sir.
1:37:01.89,1:37:03.29 I sure can.
1:37:03.59,1:37:07.59 I tell you, son, this thing really came along and knocked my wind out.
1:37:09.09,1:37:11.69 It's got me up nights. That's the truth.
1:37:13.89,1:37:15.79 The right thing to do
1:37:17.39,1:37:21.19 sometimes it's hard to know what that is.
1:37:22.19,1:37:23.59 Do you understand?
1:37:25.89,1:37:27.49 I need your help, son.
1:37:28.99,1:37:31.09 If I'm going to move on this
1:37:31.49,1:37:34.59 there can't be the least little shred of doubt.
1:37:35.39,1:37:36.39 I have to know
1:37:36.59,1:37:39.29 if what you told Dufresne was the truth.
1:37:40.79,1:37:41.99 Absolutely.
1:37:42.49,1:37:45.49 Would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury
1:37:45.69,1:37:47.69 with your hand on the Good Book
1:37:47.89,1:37:50.59 and take an oath before Almighty God himself?
1:37:50.79,1:37:52.59 Just give me that chance.
1:37:56.89,1:37:58.19 That's what I thought.
1:38:45.29,1:38:47.19 I'm sure by now you've heard.
1:38:48.99,1:38:49.99 Terrible thing.
1:38:51.59,1:38:53.09 A man that young
1:38:53.39,1:38:55.99 less than a year to go, trying to escape.
1:38:56.49,1:38:58.99 Broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.
1:38:59.79,1:39:01.29 Truly, it did.
1:39:04.29,1:39:06.69 We just have to put it behind us.
1:39:08.39,1:39:09.59 Move on.
1:39:11.19,1:39:12.69 I'm done.
1:39:13.99,1:39:15.69 Everything stops.
1:39:17.59,1:39:19.99 Get someone else to run your scams.
1:39:21.19,1:39:23.09 Nothing stops.
1:39:24.39,1:39:25.59 Nothing.
1:39:28.99,1:39:32.09 Or you will do the hardest time there is.
1:39:32.49,1:39:34.79 No more protection from the guards.
1:39:34.99,1:39:39.89 I'll pull you out of that 1-bunk Hilton and cast you down with the sodomites.
1:39:41.29,1:39:43.79 You'll think you've been fucked by a train.
1:39:45.19,1:39:46.69 And the library?
1:39:47.29,1:39:48.29 Gone.
1:39:48.89,1:39:51.29 Sealed off, brick by brick.
1:39:51.29,1:39:54.09 We'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.
1:39:54.09,1:39:56.39 They'll see the flames for miles.
1:39:56.39,1:39:59.99 We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.
1:40:01.29,1:40:04.29 You understand me? Catching my drift?
1:40:07.99,1:40:09.89 Or am I being obtuse?
1:40:21.69,1:40:24.29 Give him another month to think about it.
1:41:10.99,1:41:14.09 My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.
1:41:14.89,1:41:16.69 Like a closed book.
1:41:17.59,1:41:19.59 Complained about it all the time.
1:41:20.49,1:41:22.09 She was beautiful.
1:41:24.49,1:41:25.99 God, I loved her.
1:41:29.69,1:41:31.99 I didn't know how to show it, that's all.
1:41:34.69,1:41:36.39 I killed her, Red.
1:41:38.19,1:41:39.99 I didn't pull the trigger
1:41:41.49,1:41:43.19 but I drove her away.
1:41:44.69,1:41:47.39 That's why she died, because of me
1:41:47.59,1:41:48.99 the way I am.
1:41:57.99,1:41:59.79 That don't make you a murderer.
1:42:03.19,1:42:04.99 Bad husband, maybe.
1:42:08.59,1:42:11.89 Feel bad about it if you want, but you didn't pull the trigger.
1:42:12.09,1:42:13.39 No, I didn't.
1:42:13.79,1:42:15.69 Somebody else did.
1:42:16.99,1:42:19.09 And I wound up in here.
1:42:21.59,1:42:23.09 Bad luck, I guess.
1:42:28.39,1:42:29.79 It floats around.
1:42:30.79,1:42:33.09 It's got to land on somebody.
1:42:33.99,1:42:35.89 It was my turn, that's all.
1:42:36.59,1:42:39.29 I was in the path of the tornado.
1:42:45.29,1:42:49.19 I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has.
1:42:53.59,1:42:55.29 Think you'll ever get out of here?
1:42:56.49,1:42:57.49 Me?
1:43:00.49,1:43:01.49 Yeah.
1:43:02.89,1:43:05.19 One day, when I got a long, white beard
1:43:05.39,1:43:08.49 and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs.
1:43:10.59,1:43:12.19 I tell you where I'd go.
1:43:13.69,1:43:15.29 Zihuatanejo.
1:43:16.19,1:43:17.39 Say what?
1:43:17.69,1:43:19.49 Zihuatanejo.
1:43:20.49,1:43:22.09 It's in Mexico.
1:43:23.49,1:43:25.59 A little place on the Pacific Ocean.
1:43:26.79,1:43:29.59 You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific?
1:43:31.39,1:43:33.39 They say it has no memory.
1:43:35.39,1:43:37.99 That's where I want to live the rest of my life.
1:43:39.69,1:43:42.19 A warm place with no memory.
1:43:45.39,1:43:47.29 Open up a little hotel
1:43:48.99,1:43:50.49 right on the beach.
1:43:51.09,1:43:53.29 Buy some worthless old boat
1:43:53.89,1:43:55.49 and fix it up new.
1:43:58.19,1:43:59.49 Take my guests out
1:44:00.29,1:44:01.69 charter fishing.
1:44:05.49,1:44:07.29 Zihuatanejo.
1:44:10.79,1:44:14.69 In a place like that, I could use a man that knows how to get things.
1:44:21.19,1:44:23.99 I don't think I could make it on the outside.
1:44:30.69,1:44:32.79 I been in here most of my life.
1:44:34.19,1:44:35.99 I'm an institutional man now.
1:44:36.89,1:44:38.59 Just like Brooks was.
1:44:40.09,1:44:41.79 You underestimate yourself.
1:44:42.39,1:44:43.99 I don't think so.
1:44:47.79,1:44:51.69 In here I'm the guy who can get things for you, sure, but
1:44:52.49,1:44:54.99 outside all you need is the Yellow Pages.
1:44:55.19,1:44:57.49 Hell, I wouldn't know where to begin.
1:44:59.59,1:45:01.19 Pacific Ocean?
1:45:03.19,1:45:05.39 Scare me to death, something that big.
1:45:05.59,1:45:06.89 Not me.
1:45:08.19,1:45:10.89 I didn't shoot my wife, and I didn't shoot her lover.
1:45:12.69,1:45:15.89 Whatever mistakes I made, I've paid for them and then some.
1:45:16.89,1:45:18.39 That hotel, that boat
1:45:20.19,1:45:22.39 I don't think that's too much to ask.
1:45:27.29,1:45:29.79 You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.
1:45:29.99,1:45:31.99 This is just shitty pipe dreams.
1:45:32.39,1:45:34.89 Mexico is way down there and you're in here
1:45:35.09,1:45:36.69 and that's the way it is.
1:45:36.99,1:45:39.79 Yeah, right. That's the way it is.
1:45:41.39,1:45:43.79 It's down there and I'm in here.
1:45:46.29,1:45:49.09 I guess it comes down to a simple choice.
1:45:51.99,1:45:53.49 Get busy living
1:45:54.79,1:45:56.89 or get busy dying.
1:46:08.99,1:46:11.69 If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.
1:46:11.89,1:46:14.19 Sure, Andy. Anything.
1:46:16.09,1:46:19.89 There's a big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is?
1:46:21.39,1:46:24.49 A lot of hayfields up there. One in particular.
1:46:24.69,1:46:28.69 It's got a long rock wall with a big oak tree at the north end.
1:46:28.89,1:46:31.69 It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.
1:46:32.69,1:46:35.19 It's where I asked my wife to marry me.
1:46:36.59,1:46:38.69 We went there for a picnic
1:46:39.09,1:46:41.19 and made love under that oak
1:46:41.79,1:46:44.09 and I asked and she said yes.
1:46:48.09,1:46:49.89 Promise me, Red.
1:46:50.79,1:46:52.39 If you ever get out
1:46:52.59,1:46:54.09 find that spot.
1:46:55.29,1:47:00.09 At the base of that wall, there's a rock that has no earthly business in Maine.
1:47:01.19,1:47:04.29 Piece of black, volcanic glass.
1:47:06.89,1:47:09.59 Something's buried under it I want you to have.
1:47:10.39,1:47:11.59 What, Andy?
1:47:11.99,1:47:13.79 What's buried under there?
1:47:15.39,1:47:17.19 You'll have to pry it up
1:47:17.39,1:47:18.69 to see.
1:47:24.59,1:47:26.59 No, I'm telling you. The guy is
1:47:27.19,1:47:28.99 He's talking funny.
1:47:30.09,1:47:31.79 I'm really worried about him.
1:47:32.19,1:47:33.59 Let's keep an eye on him.
1:47:33.79,1:47:37.09 That's fine during the day, but at night he's all alone.
1:47:38.49,1:47:39.59 Oh, Lord.
1:47:40.99,1:47:41.79 What?
1:47:43.29,1:47:46.09 Andy come down to the loading dock today.
1:47:46.29,1:47:48.39 He asked me for a length of rope.
1:47:48.59,1:47:49.39 Rope?
1:47:49.59,1:47:51.29 Six feet long.
1:47:51.49,1:47:52.89 And you gave it to him.
1:47:53.79,1:47:55.49 Sure. Why wouldn't I?
1:47:55.79,1:47:57.29 Jesus! Heywood.
1:47:57.89,1:47:59.89 How was I supposed to know?
1:48:00.09,1:48:01.59 Remember Brooks Hatlen?
1:48:03.69,1:48:05.59 Andy would never do that.
1:48:06.19,1:48:07.29 Never.
1:48:09.29,1:48:10.69 I don't know.
1:48:13.49,1:48:15.49 Every man has his breaking point.
1:48:17.89,1:48:20.09 Lickety-split. Want to get home.
1:48:20.39,1:48:22.19 Just about finished, sir.
1:48:39.29,1:48:40.99 Three deposits tonight.
1:48:48.89,1:48:50.79 Get my stuff down to the laundry.
1:48:50.99,1:48:52.69 And shine my shoes.
1:48:52.89,1:48:55.79 - I want them looking like mirrors. - Yes, sir.
1:49:01.29,1:49:02.79 It's good having you back,Andy.
1:49:03.69,1:49:05.59 Place wasn't the same without you.
1:49:52.49,1:49:53.49 Lights out!
1:50:26.39,1:50:28.89 I've had some long nights in stir.
1:50:29.39,1:50:32.09 Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts
1:50:32.29,1:50:34.99 time can draw out like a blade.
1:50:40.29,1:50:43.29 That was the longest night of my life.
1:50:59.19,1:51:00.29 Give me a count!
1:51:04.79,1:51:07.69 Tier 3 south, clear!
1:51:10.79,1:51:13.99 Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!
1:51:14.19,1:51:15.19 Dufresne!
1:51:15.79,1:51:18.19 Come out. You're holding up the show!
1:51:21.39,1:51:24.79 Don't make me come down or I'll thump your skull for you!
1:51:32.29,1:51:36.19 Damn it, you're putting me behind! I got a schedule to keep.
1:51:36.39,1:51:39.69 You'd better be sick or dead in there. I shit you not!
1:51:39.89,1:51:41.19 You hear me?
1:51:47.29,1:51:49.39 Oh, my Holy God.
1:52:06.39,1:52:08.99 I want every man on this cellblock questioned.
1:52:09.39,1:52:11.99 - Start with that friend of his. - Who?
1:52:14.49,1:52:16.09 Open 237.
1:52:19.59,1:52:23.29 What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"? Don't say that to me.
1:52:24.19,1:52:25.49 Don't tell me that again.
1:52:25.69,1:52:26.69 But sir, he wasn't.
1:52:26.99,1:52:30.39 I can see that, Haig! Think I'm blind?
1:52:31.09,1:52:32.49 Is that what you're saying?
1:52:32.69,1:52:35.39 - Am I blind, Haig? - No, sir!
1:52:36.29,1:52:38.79 What about you. You blind?
1:52:39.29,1:52:41.79 Tell me what this is. Last night's count.
1:52:41.99,1:52:45.29 You see Dufresne's name there? I sure do. Right there.
1:52:45.49,1:52:46.89 "Dufresne."
1:52:48.49,1:52:49.99 He was in his cell
1:52:50.19,1:52:51.19 at lights out.
1:52:51.39,1:52:53.69 Reasonable he'd be here in the morning.
1:52:54.69,1:52:56.29 I want him found.
1:52:56.59,1:52:59.99 Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!
1:53:00.29,1:53:01.49 Yes, sir.
1:53:02.49,1:53:04.69 Let's go. Move your butts.
1:53:08.09,1:53:09.09 Stand.
1:53:10.59,1:53:11.59 Well?
1:53:15.09,1:53:16.09 Well, what?
1:53:16.29,1:53:19.69 I see you two all the time. You're thick as thieves, you are.
1:53:20.79,1:53:22.29 He must have said something.
1:53:22.99,1:53:24.59 No, sir, Warden.
1:53:24.89,1:53:25.89 Not a word.
1:53:27.79,1:53:30.29 Lord, it's a miracle!
1:53:30.89,1:53:33.49 Man vanished like a fart in the wind.
1:53:34.19,1:53:35.29 Nothing left
1:53:36.19,1:53:38.89 but some damn rocks on a windowsill.
1:53:39.09,1:53:41.79 And that cupcake on the wall. Let's ask her.
1:53:41.99,1:53:43.79 Maybe she knows.
1:53:43.99,1:53:46.79 What say there, fuzzy-britches? Feel like talking?
1:53:48.19,1:53:49.49 Guess not.
1:53:50.09,1:53:52.29 Why should she be any different?
1:53:53.29,1:53:54.99 This is a conspiracy.
1:53:55.59,1:53:57.49 That's what this is.
1:53:58.09,1:54:01.79 One big, damn conspiracy!
1:54:02.09,1:54:04.09 And everyone's in on it!
1:54:04.69,1:54:05.89 Including her!
1:54:40.89,1:54:42.59 In 1966
1:54:42.79,1:54:45.19 Andy Dufresne escaped
1:54:45.39,1:54:46.99 from Shawshank Prison.
1:54:49.19,1:54:51.79 All they found was a muddy set of prison clothes
1:54:52.39,1:54:53.99 a bar of soap
1:54:54.19,1:54:55.69 and an old rock hammer
1:54:55.89,1:54:58.39 damn near worn down to the nub.
1:55:02.89,1:55:07.69 I had thought it'd take a man 600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.
1:55:08.29,1:55:10.89 Old Andy did it in less than 20.
1:55:29.19,1:55:31.49 Oh, Andy loved geology.
1:55:32.29,1:55:35.49 I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.
1:55:35.89,1:55:37.69 An ice age here
1:55:38.09,1:55:40.59 million years of mountain building there.
1:55:41.69,1:55:44.49 Geology is the study of pressure and time.
1:55:45.29,1:55:47.29 That's all it takes, really.
1:55:48.09,1:55:49.09 Pressure
1:55:49.79,1:55:51.09 and time.
1:55:52.39,1:55:54.49 That and a big goddamn poster.
1:55:58.49,1:55:59.39 Like I said
1:55:59.89,1:56:03.89 in prison, a man will do anything to keep his mind occupied.
1:56:06.69,1:56:11.49 Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting his wall out into the exercise yard
1:56:12.09,1:56:13.99 a handful at a time.
1:56:15.29,1:56:17.39 I guess after Tommy was killed
1:56:17.59,1:56:20.59 Andy decided he'd been here long enough.
1:56:20.79,1:56:23.29 Lickety-split. I want to get home.
1:56:24.09,1:56:26.09 I'm just about finished, sir.
1:56:47.49,1:56:49.49 Three deposits tonight.
1:56:56.79,1:56:59.09 Andy did like he was told.
1:56:59.29,1:57:02.79 Buffed those shoes to a high mirror-shine.
1:57:06.49,1:57:08.79 The guards simply didn't notice.
1:57:09.09,1:57:10.49 Neither did I.
1:57:10.69,1:57:12.29 I mean, seriously
1:57:12.49,1:57:15.49 how often do you really look at a man's shoes?
1:59:18.99,1:59:22.19 Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards
1:59:22.39,1:59:25.79 of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.
1:59:26.79,1:59:29.09 Or maybe I just don't want to.
1:59:33.49,1:59:35.89 Five hundred yards.
1:59:36.39,1:59:39.39 That's the length of five football fields.
1:59:40.09,1:59:42.59 Just shy of half a mile.
2:00:37.89,2:00:42.49 The next morning, right about the time Raquel was spilling her secret
2:00:42.79,2:00:45.59 a man nobody ever laid eyes on before
2:00:45.89,2:00:48.39 strolled into the Maine National Bank.
2:00:48.99,2:00:52.19 Until that moment, he didn't exist.
2:00:52.79,2:00:55.09 Except on paper. May I help you?
2:00:55.49,2:00:57.49 He had all the proper ID
2:00:57.69,2:01:01.39 driver's license, birth certificate, Social Security card
2:01:01.79,2:01:04.29 And the signature was a spot-on match.
2:01:04.49,2:01:07.59 I must say I'm sorry to be losing your business.
2:01:07.79,2:01:09.59 I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.
2:01:10.39,2:01:11.49 Thank you.
2:01:12.09,2:01:13.29 I'm sure I will.
2:01:14.19,2:01:17.49 Here's your cashier's check, sir. Will there be anything else?
2:01:17.79,2:01:18.69 Please.
2:01:19.29,2:01:21.79 Would you add this to your outgoing mail?
2:01:22.29,2:01:23.49 I'd be happy to.
2:01:25.29,2:01:26.69 Good day, sir.
2:01:27.59,2:01:31.99 Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning.
2:01:32.49,2:01:34.09 All told, he blew town
2:01:34.29,2:01:39.09 with better than $370,000 of Warden Norton's money.
2:01:39.79,2:01:42.59 Severance pay for 19 years.
2:01:49.89,2:01:51.99 Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.
2:02:44.09,2:02:47.29 Byron Hadley? You have the right to remain silent.
2:02:47.29,2:02:52.49 If you give up this right, anything you say can be held against you in court.
2:02:52.99,2:02:56.59 I wasn't there to see, but I hear Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl
2:02:56.59,2:02:59.09 when they took him away.
2:03:04.39,2:03:08.39 Norton had no intention of going that quietly.
2:03:24.29,2:03:25.09 Samuel Norton.
2:03:25.89,2:03:28.29 We have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.
2:03:33.09,2:03:34.19 Open the door.
2:03:34.69,2:03:35.99 I'm not sure which key.
2:03:46.09,2:03:48.09 Make it easy on yourself, Norton!
2:03:59.59,2:04:02.99 I like to think the last thing that went through his head
2:04:03.29,2:04:04.79 other than that bullet
2:04:05.09,2:04:09.49 was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.
2:04:11.99,2:04:15.49 Not long after the warden deprived us of his company
2:04:15.69,2:04:17.79 I got a postcard in the mail.
2:04:19.29,2:04:22.09 It was blank, but the postmark said
2:04:22.29,2:04:24.39 Fort Hancock, Texas.
2:04:24.99,2:04:26.29 Fort Hancock
2:04:26.59,2:04:28.29 right on the border.
2:04:28.69,2:04:30.69 That's where Andy crossed.
2:04:31.29,2:04:35.29 When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down
2:04:35.79,2:04:37.99 it always makes me laugh.
2:04:39.89,2:04:41.39 Andy Dufresne
2:04:41.79,2:04:43.79 who crawled through a river of shit
2:04:43.99,2:04:46.39 and came out clean on the other side.
2:04:47.29,2:04:48.59 Andy Dufresne
2:04:49.39,2:04:50.99 headed for the Pacific.
2:04:53.99,2:04:56.19 Hadley's got him by the throat, right?
2:04:56.39,2:05:00.19 He says, " I believe this boy's about to have himself an accident."
2:05:00.39,2:05:03.19 Those of us who knew him best talk about him often.
2:05:03.89,2:05:05.59 I swear, the stuff he pulled
2:05:05.79,2:05:08.79 "My friends could use a couple of beers."
2:05:09.09,2:05:10.79 And he got it!
2:05:11.99,2:05:14.39 Sometimes it makes me sad, though
2:05:14.69,2:05:16.09 Andy being gone.
2:05:16.79,2:05:21.09 I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged.
2:05:21.39,2:05:23.49 Their feathers are just too bright.
2:05:25.19,2:05:26.89 And when they fly away
2:05:27.39,2:05:31.79 the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.
2:05:32.79,2:05:34.09 But still
2:05:34.59,2:05:38.89 the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.
2:05:43.09,2:05:45.49 I guess I just miss my friend.
2:06:10.19,2:06:11.09 Please sit down.
2:06:16.99,2:06:18.49 Ellis Boyd Redding
2:06:19.09,2:06:22.29 your files say you've served 40 years of a life sentence.
2:06:23.09,2:06:25.29 You feel you've been rehabilitated?
2:06:27.09,2:06:28.69 Rehabilitated?
2:06:30.69,2:06:32.59 Well, now, let me see.
2:06:33.59,2:06:35.99 I don't have any idea what that means.
2:06:38.09,2:06:40.29 It means you're ready to rejoin society
2:06:40.89,2:06:43.19 I know what you think it means, sonny.
2:06:45.39,2:06:47.39 To me it's just a made-up word.
2:06:48.79,2:06:51.09 A politician's word so that
2:06:51.49,2:06:54.99 young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie
2:06:55.49,2:06:57.09 and have a job.
2:06:59.09,2:07:01.19 What do you really want to know?
2:07:01.99,2:07:03.79 Am I sorry for what I did?
2:07:03.79,2:07:05.49 Well, are you?
2:07:06.89,2:07:10.29 There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.
2:07:11.09,2:07:15.09 Not because I'm in here or because you think I should.
2:07:17.99,2:07:21.09 I look back on the way I was then
2:07:22.69,2:07:24.39 a young
2:07:24.99,2:07:28.99 stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.
2:07:31.49,2:07:33.79 I want to talk to him.
2:07:35.09,2:07:38.19 I want to try and talk some sense to him.
2:07:38.29,2:07:40.79 Tell him the way things are.
2:07:42.39,2:07:44.39 But I can't.
2:07:45.99,2:07:48.59 That kid's long gone
2:07:49.19,2:07:52.49 and this old man is all that's left.
2:07:53.39,2:07:55.39 I got to live with that.
2:07:56.19,2:07:58.29 Rehabilitated?
2:07:58.29,2:08:00.69 It's just a bullshit word.
2:08:01.09,2:08:03.89 So you go on and stamp your forms
2:08:03.90,2:08:06.39 sonny, and stop wasting my time.
2:08:07.09,2:08:09.69 Because to tell you the truth
2:08:09.69,2:08:12.19 I don't give a shit.
2:09:38.19,2:09:40.19 Here you go, miss.
2:09:42.49,2:09:44.09 Restroom break?
2:09:49.39,2:09:54.49 You don't need to ask me every time you need to go take a piss. Just go.
2:10:06.89,2:10:10.59 Forty years I've been asking permission to piss.
2:10:10.89,2:10:14.39 I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.
2:10:17.39,2:10:20.09 There's a harsh truth to face.
2:10:21.19,2:10:24.69 No way I'm going to make it on the outside.
2:10:31.99,2:10:35.99 All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole
2:10:36.49,2:10:39.49 so maybe they'd send me back.
2:10:44.19,2:10:47.19 Terrible thing, to live in fear.
2:10:47.49,2:10:49.39 Brooks Hatlen knew it.
2:10:49.39,2:10:51.89 Knew it all too well.
2:10:52.89,2:10:56.69 All I want is to be back where things make sense.
2:10:56.69,2:10:59.99 Where I won't have to be afraid all the time.
2:11:01.49,2:11:04.39 Only one thing stops me.
2:11:05.29,2:11:08.19 A promise I made to Andy.
2:11:28.19,2:11:29.89 There it is.
2:11:39.89,2:11:42.19 Much obliged, sir.
2:15:20.89,2:15:22.39 Dear Red:
2:15:22.39,2:15:25.09 If you're reading this, you've gotten out
2:15:25.09,2:15:29.39 and if you've come this far, maybe you'd come a bit further.
2:15:29.39,2:15:32.49 You remember the name of the town, don't you?
2:15:34.19,2:15:36.29 Zihuatanejo.
2:15:37.29,2:15:41.29 I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels.
2:15:41.39,2:15:45.39 I'll keep an eye out for you, and the chessboard ready.
2:15:45.79,2:15:47.49 Remember, Red
2:15:47.49,2:15:49.79 hope is a good thing
2:15:49.79,2:15:51.99 maybe the best of things.
2:15:51.99,2:15:54.69 And no good thing ever dies.
2:15:54.69,2:15:57.79 I will be hoping that this letter finds you
2:15:57.79,2:15:59.99 and finds you well.
2:15:59.99,2:16:01.49 Your friend
2:16:01.49,2:16:03.19 Andy.
2:16:36.49,2:16:38.39 "Get busy living
2:16:38.39,2:16:40.89 or get busy dying. "
2:16:42.99,2:16:45.69 That's goddamn right.
2:16:50.39,2:16:52.79 For the second time in my life
2:16:52.79,2:16:55.89 I'm guilty of committing a crime.
2:16:56.39,2:16:58.89 Parole violation.
2:16:58.99,2:17:03.29 Of course I doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that.
2:17:03.39,2:17:05.59 Not for an old crook like me.
2:17:05.59,2:17:08.19 Fort Hancock, Texas, please.
2:17:11.29,2:17:16.49 I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head.
2:17:16.49,2:17:19.99 I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel.
2:17:19.99,2:17:22.69 A free man at the start of a long journey
2:17:22.69,2:17:25.89 whose conclusion is uncertain.
2:17:28.29,2:17:31.59 I hope I can make it across the border.
2:17:32.49,2:17:36.09 I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.
2:17:37.39,2:17:41.99 I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.
2:17:43.89,2:17:45.09 I hope.


0:02:05.79,0:02:06.80 德弗瑞恩先生
0:02:06.90,0:02:12.29 描述一下你太太被谋杀当晚 你曾和她谈过些什么?
0:02:16.99,0:02:18.59 一些很糟糕的话
0:02:18.99,0:02:23.29 她说她很高兴我已知道 她不想再偷偷摸摸了
0:02:24.89,0:02:28.39 她说她想离婚
0:02:28.59,0:02:32.29 - 你当时有什么反应? - 我对她说我不会在乎的
0:02:32.49,0:02:35.59 "在我看见你在雷诺市前,下地狱吧!"
0:02:35.79,0:02:39.19 你的邻居曾听你说过这些话吧?
0:02:40.19,0:02:41.89 随他们怎么说
0:02:42.39,0:02:44.89 我当时很不开心 什么都不记得了
0:02:45.19,0:02:47.59 你和太太争吵后发生了什么事?
0:02:48.79,0:02:50.59 她收拾好行李
0:02:51.69,0:02:54.89 到昆汀先生家里去了
0:02:55.49,0:02:59.49 格伦·昆汀 职业高尔夫教练
0:02:59.79,0:03:02.99 你知道他是你妻子的情人
0:03:05.29,0:03:06.49 你跟踪她了吗?
0:03:07.79,0:03:09.89 我先去了几间酒吧找
0:03:10.09,0:03:14.49 接着 我开车去了昆汀家 但他们不在家里
0:03:14.99,0:03:16.59 我把车停在街角
0:03:17.29,0:03:18.29 等在那里
0:03:18.49,0:03:20.09 有何企图吗?
0:03:20.79,0:03:22.19 我不太确定
0:03:23.29,0:03:24.79 我非常困惑
0:03:24.99,0:03:25.99 还有点醉
0:03:27.59,0:03:28.89 我觉得
0:03:29.09,0:03:31.19 我只是想吓一吓他们
0:03:31.39,0:03:34.79 他们到家后 你就进屋杀了他们
0:03:35.69,0:03:37.09 没有 我控制了自己
0:03:37.29,0:03:40.99 我开车回家睡觉来忘记一切
0:03:41.19,0:03:44.09 在回家的路上 我把枪扔进了河里
0:03:44.29,0:03:46.29 我很肯定这一点
0:03:46.59,0:03:50.59 但我感到奇怪的是 第二天早上清洁女工发现
0:03:50.79,0:03:53.39 你太太和她的情人死在床上
0:03:53.69,0:03:55.69 致死的子弹是出自点38口径的手枪
0:03:57.09,0:04:01.09 德福瑞恩先生 你和我一样都觉得那是巧合吗?
0:04:02.19,0:04:03.19 确实是巧合
0:04:03.39,0:04:06.59 你仍坚持说你在凶案发生前
0:04:06.79,0:04:08.89 已经把枪扔进河里了吗?
0:04:09.09,0:04:11.29 这对你很有利
0:04:11.49,0:04:13.19 这是事实
0:04:13.49,0:04:18.09 警察在河里找了三天 但他们没有找到你的枪
0:04:18.29,0:04:22.29 所以无法鉴定
0:04:22.59,0:04:26.09 死者身上的子弹是否出自你的枪
0:04:26.69,0:04:29.09 这对你来说
0:04:29.59,0:04:32.99 也非常有利 不是吗 德福瑞恩先生?
0:04:34.39,0:04:36.39 因为我是无辜的
0:04:36.59,0:04:41.29 所以我发现找不到枪对我非常不利
0:04:41.36,0:04:43.40 ∮ 如果我不在乎
0:04:47.37,0:04:50.62 ∮ 我会确信
0:04:50.70,0:04:55.29 ∮ 这是无与伦比的爱...
0:04:59.19,0:05:02.49 各位先生女士 你们听到了所有的证据
0:05:02.69,0:05:06.59 我们有他犯罪的动机 我们找到他的脚印
0:05:06.79,0:05:09.59 留有他的指纹的子弹头
0:05:09.79,0:05:12.79 打碎的酒瓶上也留有他的指纹
0:05:12.99,0:05:14.59 最重要的是
0:05:14.79,0:05:17.79 我们知道他的妻子和她的情人
0:05:17.99,0:05:20.09 双双倒卧在血泊中
0:05:21.19,0:05:23.89 他们是犯了错
0:05:25.09,0:05:27.59 但他们所犯的错严重到
0:05:27.89,0:05:30.09 需要用死来赎罪吗?
0:05:30.29,0:05:32.59 当你们考虑时
0:05:33.99,0:05:35.79 请想想这个
0:05:36.69,0:05:40.39 一个弹匣只能装六颗子弹 而不是八颗
0:05:40.59,0:05:44.29 我肯定这不只是一时冲动而犯下的罪行
0:05:44.49,0:05:47.29 那至少是可以理解的 即使不能宽恕
0:05:47.49,0:05:48.59 不!
0:05:48.79,0:05:50.39 这是复仇
0:05:50.40,0:05:54.49 一个冷血者的复仇 看看这些:
0:05:54.69,0:05:57.09 每个死者都身中四枪
0:05:57.89,0:05:59.59 总共是八枪而不是六枪
0:06:00.09,0:06:03.69 那表明子弹打完后
0:06:03.89,0:06:05.89 他还停下来装子弹
0:06:06.09,0:06:09.59 以便再次向他们开枪
0:06:09.79,0:06:12.29 每人多加一枪
0:06:13.09,0:06:14.89 就在头部
0:06:18.39,0:06:23.19 德弗瑞恩先生 我觉得你非常冷血
0:06:23.59,0:06:25.69 看着你都令我毛骨耸然
0:06:27.69,0:06:30.39 我以本州赋予我的权利
0:06:30.59,0:06:34.89 判处你两项终身监禁
0:06:35.29,0:06:37.79 分别为两位死者 退庭!
0:07:02.89,0:07:04.09 坐下来
0:07:08.59,0:07:11.49 你因被判终身监禁己在此二十年?
0:07:12.39,0:07:15.59 - 是的 先生 - 你感到后悔吗?
0:07:15.99,0:07:18.59 是的 当然 先生
0:07:19.79,0:07:21.69 我是说 我得到了教训
0:07:22.79,0:07:26.29 我敢说我已经完全改变了
0:07:29.49,0:07:31.89 我不会再危害社会
0:07:32.09,0:07:33.99 这是神的真理
0:07:38.79,0:07:40.49 "不合格"
0:08:10.29,0:08:11.59 嗨 瑞德
0:08:11.79,0:08:13.09 怎么样了?
0:08:13.29,0:08:15.49 不同的日子 同样的结果
0:08:15.79,0:08:17.59 我知道你的感受的
0:08:17.79,0:08:19.79 我下星期又要被否决了
0:08:20.59,0:08:23.09 对 我上星期也被否决了
0:08:23.39,0:08:24.69 一向如此
0:08:24.89,0:08:26.29 嗨 瑞德 给我一包烟
0:08:26.49,0:08:29.79 滚开!你已欠我五包烟了
0:08:29.99,0:08:30.99 - 是四包! - 五包!
0:08:32.09,0:08:35.59 我想在美国的每个联邦或州监狱里都有像我一样的人物
0:08:35.79,0:08:37.59 就是能够给你搞到东西的家伙
0:08:37.79,0:08:40.89 定制的香烟 一包大麻
0:08:41.09,0:08:44.49 为庆祝你儿子或女儿高中毕业的一瓶白兰地  只要你喜欢
0:08:44.69,0:08:46.79 或者几乎所有东西
0:08:46.99,0:08:50.79 是的 先生 我是个冷酷的人
0:08:53.69,0:08:56.69 所以1949年当安迪·德福瑞恩来找我
0:08:56.89,0:09:00.39 问能否弄张丽塔·海华丝的图片进来时
0:09:00.59,0:09:02.89 我告诉他"没问题"
0:09:44.79,0:09:46.89 安迪·德弗瑞恩在1947年来到肖申克监狱
0:09:47.19,0:09:50.99 罪名是谋杀他的妻子和她的情人
0:09:51.39,0:09:55.39 入狱以前 他是波特兰银行的副总裁
0:09:55.89,0:09:57.69 对他来说是年青有为
0:10:40.89,0:10:42.69 你会说英语吗?
0:10:42.89,0:10:44.79 跟着这个长官走
0:10:57.49,0:11:01.79 我一生中从没见过这么差劲的人
0:11:01.99,0:11:04.59 过来啊! 到这里来
0:11:27.89,0:11:29.29 今天要赌吗 瑞德?
0:11:29.59,0:11:31.29 赌烟还是赌钱?
0:11:31.49,0:11:33.19 香烟 我赌两根
0:11:33.79,0:11:35.29 好吧 你买哪一个?
0:11:35.49,0:11:37.29 那个又矮又瘦的

0:11:42.39,0:11:44.59 你输定了 孩子

0:11:55.89,0:11:57.59 今天又有新人
0:11:58.29,0:11:59.79 我们又有的玩了
0:12:00.49,0:12:04.09 我承认我初次见到安迪的时候 没什么特别的感觉
0:12:04.69,0:12:07.59 他看起来似乎风一吹就会倒
0:12:07.89,0:12:09.99 这就是我对他的第一印象
0:12:10.19,0:12:11.69 你买谁?
0:12:11.89,0:12:15.19 那个高个子
0:12:15.39,0:12:17.49 那个人?不可能的
0:12:17.69,0:12:19.99 我赌十根香烟 那可是大赌注
0:12:20.19,0:12:22.29 谁来证明我看错了?
0:12:22.49,0:12:24.29 海伍德?济格?
0:12:24.59,0:12:25.89 史基?
0:12:26.09,0:12:27.39 弗洛德?
0:12:28.29,0:12:30.39 四个胆小鬼
0:12:30.59,0:12:33.39 回囚房去 要查房了
0:12:33.59,0:12:36.89 所有犯人都回囚房去
0:12:57.29,0:12:58.39 向右转
0:12:58.59,0:12:59.89 往前看
0:13:12.99,0:13:15.59 这是哈德利先生 他是这里的看守长
0:13:15.79,0:13:17.89 我是诺顿 这里的典狱长
0:13:18.09,0:13:20.29 你们都被判有罪了
0:13:20.59,0:13:22.59 因此被送到这里来
0:13:23.19,0:13:24.59 规则一
0:13:24.79,0:13:26.19 不得亵渎上帝
0:13:26.79,0:13:30.19 在我的监狱里不得有人亵渎上帝
0:13:30.39,0:13:31.59 其他的条例
0:13:31.79,0:13:35.09 其他的条例 你们慢慢就会知道了 还有问题吗?
0:13:35.49,0:13:36.49 何时吃饭?
0:13:45.19,0:13:47.19 我们叫你吃的时候你就吃
0:13:47.39,0:13:50.69 叫你去厕所你就去厕所
0:13:50.89,0:13:53.69 明白吗?笨蛋?
0:13:55.59,0:13:56.99 站好
0:13:57.19,0:13:58.99 我只相信两样东西
0:13:59.19,0:14:01.59 纪律和圣经
0:14:02.09,0:14:04.19 在这里 你们两样都有
0:14:04.99,0:14:07.09 把你们的思想交给上帝
0:14:07.69,0:14:09.99 你们的身体交给我
0:14:11.79,0:14:13.69 欢迎来到肖申克监狱
0:14:18.89,0:14:20.19 解开他们
0:14:25.69,0:14:26.99 转过身
0:14:33.89,0:14:35.29 够了
0:14:36.19,0:14:38.19 到笼子边上去
0:14:39.19,0:14:41.79 转身 给他消毒
0:14:43.89,0:14:45.19 转身
0:14:47.99,0:14:50.69 出来 去领你们的衣服和圣经
0:14:50.89,0:14:52.19 下一个!
0:14:54.49,0:14:55.99 往右走
0:14:56.19,0:14:57.19 右边 右边
0:14:57.79,0:14:58.99 左边
0:14:59.49,0:15:03.29 毫无疑问 第一晚是最难熬的
0:15:03.69,0:15:06.79 赤裸裸的进囚笼 就像刚出生时那样
0:15:06.99,0:15:10.79 消毒药粉令皮肤像被火烧一样
0:15:11.49,0:15:13.89 他们把你丢进囚笼
0:15:14.09,0:15:16.39 关上铁门
0:15:16.89,0:15:19.09 那时你才感到这是真实的
0:15:19.69,0:15:22.69 瞬间过去的一切都离你而去
0:15:23.19,0:15:27.19 剩下的只有对过去的回忆
0:15:28.39,0:15:31.79 很多新来的人在第一晚都几乎发疯了
0:15:32.09,0:15:35.09 有些人甚至还痛哭流涕
0:15:35.59,0:15:37.19 一向都如此的
0:15:38.09,0:15:39.89 唯一的问题是
0:15:40.09,0:15:41.89 谁会是第一个呢?
0:15:43.29,0:15:46.19 我想那是用来赌博的最佳玩意
0:15:47.29,0:15:49.99 我把赌注押在安迪·德弗瑞恩身上
0:15:58.99,0:16:00.59 熄灯
0:16:21.19,0:16:23.49 我还记得我在这里的第一晚
0:16:24.29,0:16:27.29 似乎是很久以前的事了

0:16:36.49,0:16:38.29 你怕黑吗?

0:16:43.49,0:16:46.99 蠢猪!
0:16:55.29,0:16:58.49 他们总是喜欢逗新人
0:16:58.89,0:17:01.79 不达目的 誓不罢休

0:19:24.79,0:19:27.09 所有的人都不会放过的
0:19:30.49,0:19:34.19 把他抬到医疗室去
0:19:48.49,0:19:53.19 德福瑞恩第一晚就让我输了两包烟
0:19:53.39,0:19:56.39 他整晚一言不发
0:20:11.69,0:20:14.09 北仓三楼 出来
0:20:14.99,0:20:16.79 北仓二楼 出来

0:22:39.79,0:22:42.59 但我很喜欢我下注的那个人
0:22:42.79,0:22:45.39 我见到他就要亲他一下
0:22:45.99,0:22:49.99 你为何不把香烟分给他点?

0:22:57.39,0:22:58.49 死了
0:22:59.29,0:23:01.49 哈德利打爆了他的头
0:23:01.69,0:23:03.89 晚上医生都回家了
0:23:04.39,0:23:06.69 可怜的家伙就在那里躺到早上
0:23:06.89,0:23:09.39 可是那时我们已经无能为力了
0:23:15.69,0:23:16.99 他叫什么?
0:23:20.39,0:23:21.59 你说什么?
0:23:23.49,0:23:25.89 我只是想问有人知道他的名字吗?
0:23:26.59,0:23:29.39 关你屁事 新来的?
0:23:30.39,0:23:33.49 他叫什么都无所谓了 他已经死了
0:23:55.59,0:23:57.49 嗨 有人和你一起吗?
0:23:59.69,0:24:01.49 有人喜欢你吗?
0:24:03.19,0:24:05.69 嗨 在这里我们都需要朋友
0:24:05.99,0:24:07.69 我可以做你的朋友
0:24:16.89,0:24:18.29 难得手
0:24:20.39,0:24:21.89 我喜欢
0:24:28.89,0:24:32.09 安迪一开始很自闭
0:24:32.39,0:24:34.39 我猜他在想办法
0:24:34.79,0:24:37.69 接受牢里的生活
0:24:38.39,0:24:41.59 一个月以后他才开口
0:24:41.79,0:24:44.19 和某人谈话
0:24:45.39,0:24:46.89 就像你们所看见的
0:24:47.39,0:24:49.29 那个人就是我
0:24:57.99,0:24:59.79 我是安迪·德福瑞恩
0:25:01.09,0:25:02.79 杀妻的银行家
0:25:04.99,0:25:06.39 你为何要杀你的妻子?
0:25:06.79,0:25:08.79 我没有杀她
0:25:09.49,0:25:11.29 你很适应合这里
0:25:11.49,0:25:14.19 这儿每个人都是无辜的 你不知道吗?
0:25:14.79,0:25:17.99 你为进监狱? 我什么都没做 律师害了我
0:25:21.09,0:25:23.59 听说你很冷酷
0:25:23.79,0:25:27.39 你以为自己很了不起 对吗?
0:25:27.59,0:25:29.09 你怎么认为呢?
0:25:29.49,0:25:32.49 说实话 我还不知道
0:25:33.69,0:25:36.49 我知道你能拿到违禁品
0:25:37.49,0:25:40.79 我能搞到
0:25:40.99,0:25:43.49 你能给我个鹤嘴槌吗?
0:25:44.19,0:25:45.49 鹤嘴槌
0:25:45.89,0:25:48.59 要干什么? 你关心这个干吗?
0:25:49.89,0:25:52.59 如果是牙刷我就不会问你 我会开个价钱
0:25:52.79,0:25:55.29 但是牙刷没有杀伤力 对吗?
0:25:56.79,0:25:58.19 有道理
0:25:58.69,0:26:01.29 一个鹤嘴槌有六至七英寸长
0:26:01.49,0:26:03.79 看起来像个小锄子 锄子?
0:26:03.99,0:26:05.19 打石用的
0:26:07.89,0:26:09.09 石英 石英?
0:26:12.99,0:26:16.49 还有云母、页岩
0:26:17.69,0:26:18.99 石灰岩
0:26:19.19,0:26:20.39 这么说吧
0:26:21.29,0:26:23.09 我收集石头
0:26:23.59,0:26:26.69 我想在这里最大限度的重操旧业
0:26:26.89,0:26:30.09 或许你想用它们攻击某人
0:26:31.49,0:26:33.09 不 我在这里没有敌人
0:26:33.29,0:26:35.59 不会?等着瞧吧
0:26:37.19,0:26:38.79 话说回来
0:26:39.49,0:26:41.99 那对姐妹花很喜欢你
0:26:43.39,0:26:45.19 特别是伯格斯
0:26:46.19,0:26:49.59 就算跟他们说我不好此道也没用
0:26:49.79,0:26:51.29 他们也不是
0:26:51.49,0:26:54.89 是这个地方让他们这样
0:26:59.39,0:27:03.79 畜牲只知道用暴力 不管他人喜不喜欢
0:27:03.99,0:27:07.59 如果我是你 我会加倍小心
0:27:07.79,0:27:10.49 谢谢你的忠告 忠告免费
0:27:10.89,0:27:12.79 你知道我担心什么
0:27:12.99,0:27:15.59 就算我有麻烦也不会用鹤嘴槌的
0:27:16.59,0:27:20.59 那我猜你想挖个洞逃出去
0:27:21.49,0:27:23.19 我说漏了什么?什么东西这么好笑
0:27:23.59,0:27:26.29 等你看见鹤嘴槌你就明白了
0:27:28.09,0:27:30.39 买这个东西一般要多少钱?
0:27:30.59,0:27:33.09 七美元 五金铺的零售价
0:27:33.59,0:27:35.99 我一般要加20%
0:27:36.19,0:27:38.59 但这东西很特殊
0:27:38.79,0:27:43.29 风险越大 价钱越高 一口价 10元吧
0:27:43.49,0:27:44.79 就10元吧
0:27:46.59,0:27:48.59 你那是浪费钱
0:27:48.89,0:27:50.09 为什么?
0:27:51.59,0:27:54.59 这里的人喜欢突击检查
0:27:56.19,0:27:58.19 他们找到鹤嘴槌就会被充公
0:27:58.39,0:28:00.49 被他们发现的话 你别把我供出来
0:28:00.69,0:28:02.89 否则的话就别想
0:28:03.39,0:28:06.49 再和我做生意了 你明白了吗?
0:28:07.29,0:28:08.89 我知道了
0:28:10.09,0:28:12.19 谢谢你 你叫...?
0:28:12.39,0:28:13.39 瑞德
0:28:14.19,0:28:15.49 都叫我瑞德
0:28:16.89,0:28:18.49 这名字怎么来的?
0:28:22.29,0:28:24.29 可能因为我是半个爱尔兰人吧
0:28:32.49,0:28:35.39 我现在明白他们为何看中他了
0:28:36.19,0:28:38.69 他不太说话
0:28:38.99,0:28:42.99 一举一动都不像普通的人
0:28:43.49,0:28:44.99 他漫步着
0:28:45.19,0:28:49.19 就像在公园里散步
0:28:49.59,0:28:54.19 像穿了件隐形的外套
0:28:56.19,0:28:58.39 可以说
0:28:58.69,0:29:00.89 开始我对安迪就有好感
0:29:02.49,0:29:06.29 快点! 我赶时间的
0:29:09.59,0:29:12.09 快点
0:29:14.69,0:29:17.59 你太太对你好吗?
0:29:55.79,0:29:57.19 安迪说得很对
0:29:57.49,0:29:59.69 我最终拿到那玩意
0:29:59.99,0:30:02.39 用这东西来挖隧道
0:30:02.59,0:30:05.09 起码要花六百年
0:30:08.89,0:30:11.29 - 要书吗? - 今天不用了
0:30:17.29,0:30:18.29 要书吗?
0:30:25.69,0:30:27.79 送到德福瑞恩那里去
0:30:45.49,0:30:47.09 德福瑞恩 这是你要的书
0:30:52.09,0:30:53.39 谢谢
0:30:59.59,0:31:03.29 漂白粉不够用了 你再去后面拿点来
0:31:40.69,0:31:42.19 这可以弄瞎你的眼睛
0:31:42.59,0:31:44.99 亲爱的
0:31:57.49,0:31:59.49 你不懂
0:31:59.69,0:32:01.19 你越挣扎越过瘾
0:32:09.39,0:32:12.49 我很想说安迪打赢了
0:32:12.69,0:32:14.69 或者姐妹花放过了他
0:32:15.29,0:32:17.09 我希望能这么说
0:32:17.29,0:32:20.29 但是监狱不是童话世界
0:32:21.39,0:32:23.39 他从没提起是谁
0:32:23.59,0:32:25.19 但我们都很清楚
0:32:30.09,0:32:32.59 事情就这样持续了一段时间
0:32:32.99,0:32:35.49 监狱里的生活都是常规
0:32:35.69,0:32:37.69 和更多的常规
0:32:40.19,0:32:43.69 安迪的脸上经常出现新的伤痕
0:32:45.19,0:32:46.99 姐妹花不断地骚扰他
0:32:47.29,0:32:49.29 有时候他能逃脱
0:32:49.59,0:32:50.99 但有时不能
0:32:52.19,0:32:54.39 对安迪来说
0:32:54.99,0:32:56.69 这已经成了他的常规
0:32:57.59,0:33:00.99 我相信最初的两年是最糟糕的
0:33:01.49,0:33:04.89 我也相信事情再继续这样下去
0:33:05.19,0:33:07.59 这个地方会夺去他的精神
0:33:08.39,0:33:11.19 但是 在1949年的春天
0:33:11.39,0:33:13.29 上头决定
0:33:13.49,0:33:16.79 工厂的屋顶需要重修
0:33:16.99,0:33:20.19 我需要12名自愿者工作一星期
0:33:20.99,0:33:22.39 你们知道的
0:33:23.19,0:33:26.69 特殊的工作有特殊的好处
0:33:26.89,0:33:29.29 这是户外劳动
0:33:29.69,0:33:33.99 五月是户外劳动的好时间
0:33:34.19,0:33:35.59 排好队
0:33:35.79,0:33:38.89 超过100人报名参加劳动
0:33:43.19,0:33:46.19 威勒斯·E·安戈
0:33:46.69,0:33:49.09 艾力斯·瑞丁
0:33:49.29,0:33:50.79 你明白了吧?
0:33:51.29,0:33:54.59 我和几个我认识的都被选中了
0:33:54.79,0:33:56.79 安迪·德福瑞恩
0:33:57.19,0:34:00.09 这只花了我们每人一包烟的代价
0:34:00.59,0:34:03.09 我当然也像往常一样赚了20%
0:34:03.29,0:34:06.79 德州的律师打长途给我
0:34:06.99,0:34:08.49 我说 "喂?"
0:34:08.79,0:34:12.39 他说 "很遗憾 你哥哥死了"
0:34:12.59,0:34:16.49 - 我很难过 - 我并不难过 他是个混蛋
0:34:16.69,0:34:18.89 离家多年 早就当他死了
0:34:19.09,0:34:21.39 这个律师对我说
0:34:21.59,0:34:25.59 "他死的时候很富有" 有价值超过百万的油井
0:34:26.39,0:34:28.29 超过百万的?
0:34:28.59,0:34:33.09 - 有些混蛋的运气有时候就是好 - 有你的份吗?
0:34:33.69,0:34:36.49 三万五千块 那就他留给我的
0:34:36.69,0:34:37.89 - 美元? - 对
0:34:38.59,0:34:41.59 真不错 就像中了彩
0:34:41.99,0:34:43.09 不是吗?
0:34:43.29,0:34:46.19 笨蛋 你想政府会如何对我?
0:34:46.39,0:34:48.79 他们会拿去一大半
0:34:49.59,0:34:50.89 可怜的布朗
0:34:51.79,0:34:54.99 真是走运 嗯?奇耻大辱
0:34:55.19,0:34:57.39 有些人觉得很糟糕
0:34:57.69,0:34:59.09 安迪 你傻了吗?
0:34:59.29,0:35:01.19 看着你的拖把 嘿!
0:35:01.39,0:35:04.39 虽然要交点税 但你还可以
0:35:04.59,0:35:07.39 也许够买辆新车 但接着呢?
0:35:07.59,0:35:10.29 你必须为新车上该死的税 维修和保养
0:35:10.35,0:35:13.69 孩子们会缠着你带着他们兜风
0:35:13.89,0:35:17.59 如果年底算错了税金 还要掏自己的腰包
0:35:17.79,0:35:19.89 告诉你! 山姆叔叔
0:35:20.19,0:35:24.19 他只是假仁假义
0:35:26.79,0:35:28.99 他在找死 继续干活吧
0:35:29.19,0:35:31.69 什么兄弟 呸!
0:35:36.69,0:35:38.09 哈德利先生
0:35:38.99,0:35:40.29 你信任你太太吗?
0:35:41.99,0:35:43.39 噢 这很有趣
0:35:43.99,0:35:46.59 你给我挨揍的话也许更有趣
0:35:46.79,0:35:50.09 我是说 你是否会认为她对你不忠?
0:35:51.29,0:35:54.59 让开点 米特 让他自己出意外
0:35:54.89,0:35:55.89 他会把他推下去的
0:35:56.09,0:35:57.99 如果你信任她 你就能
0:35:58.19,0:35:59.59 拿到三万五千元
0:36:00.29,0:36:03.59 - 你说什么? - 三万五千元
0:36:03.69,0:36:04.69 一分不少
0:36:04.89,0:36:07.99 你最好说明白点 小子 不然你完蛋了
0:36:08.19,0:36:10.49 你要拿到这笔钱的话 就把它送给你妻子
0:36:10.69,0:36:14.59 政府允许一次性赠与配偶金额的上限是六万美元
0:36:14.79,0:36:17.19 - 胡扯!免税的吗? - 免税的
0:36:17.39,0:36:19.39 国税局一毛钱也拿不走
0:36:19.79,0:36:22.19 你是那个谋杀妻子的银行家吗?
0:36:22.49,0:36:25.79 我为何要相信你?我会在这杀了你!
0:36:25.99,0:36:28.89 这是合法的 你可以去问国税局 他们会给你同样的回答
0:36:29.09,0:36:33.09 我知道即使我不告诉你 你也能查到的
0:36:33.29,0:36:36.99 我不需要你来教我怎么做
0:36:37.19,0:36:40.59 当然 但你需要有人帮你逃税
0:36:40.79,0:36:42.39 你需要请一个律师
0:36:42.59,0:36:44.79 那些华盛顿的混蛋?
0:36:45.29,0:36:48.79 我想我能帮你 那你就能省点钱
0:36:48.99,0:36:51.09 我帮你填好文件
0:36:51.29,0:36:52.99 几乎是免费的
0:36:54.29,0:36:57.59 我只要求给每个同事三瓶啤酒
0:36:58.49,0:37:00.09 同事?你真的发达了
0:37:00.89,0:37:03.39 一个户外工作的人能有啤酒喝的话
0:37:03.59,0:37:07.09 会感觉更像一个男人 那是我的意见
0:37:07.49,0:37:08.49 长官
0:37:12.49,0:37:14.39 你们在看什么?
0:37:14.59,0:37:16.19 继续干活
0:37:25.69,0:37:27.69 就这样
0:37:27.89,0:37:30.49 在完工前的第二天
0:37:30.69,0:37:35.29 在49年的春天里 一群在工厂上面装修的罪犯
0:37:35.49,0:37:38.59 早上十点坐在屋顶上
0:37:38.79,0:37:44.29 享受着清凉的啤酒和肖申克最严密的保护
0:37:44.49,0:37:47.79 这种事在肖申克从没有发生
0:37:47.99,0:37:50.39 趁凉喝 女士们
0:37:51.49,0:37:56.09 他还装作很大度似的走来走去
0:37:57.19,0:38:01.69 我们坐着喝着啤酒 阳光洒在肩头 觉得是个自由人
0:38:02.09,0:38:05.49 感觉就像在装修自己家的屋项
0:38:05.69,0:38:08.49 我们就像造物主
0:38:09.09,0:38:10.69 安迪看起来
0:38:10.89,0:38:13.59 也有点不同了
0:38:13.79,0:38:16.29 他脸上露出奇怪的笑容
0:38:16.49,0:38:18.69 望着我们喝他的啤酒
0:38:26.79,0:38:28.19 要来点吗?
0:38:28.89,0:38:31.79 不 谢谢 我戒酒了
0:38:35.79,0:38:38.79 如果他不和狱警打交道
0:38:39.49,0:38:43.29 或许就不能和我们交上朋友
0:38:44.09,0:38:45.09 我?
0:38:45.29,0:38:48.09 我觉得他这样做只是为了在此感到自由
0:38:48.59,0:38:50.79 哪怕只是一小会儿
0:38:53.39,0:38:54.49 将军
0:38:56.39,0:38:58.99 象棋 这是一个王者的游戏 什么?
0:38:59.29,0:39:00.99 文明 战略
0:39:01.69,0:39:04.59 我一点都没察觉 我讨厌这样
0:39:04.89,0:39:06.69 改天我教教你吧
0:39:08.29,0:39:09.19 好的
0:39:09.69,0:39:11.39 或许你我可合作
0:39:11.69,0:39:14.69 你找对人了 我能弄到很多东西
0:39:14.89,0:39:18.89 我们可以合作做买卖 我来雕刻
0:39:19.09,0:39:22.39 一面是石膏像 另一面是肥皂石 你觉得怎样?
0:39:22.99,0:39:24.39 这需要很多时间
0:39:24.59,0:39:27.19 时间不是问题 只是没有石头
0:39:27.39,0:39:29.39 操场里拾到的都是小石头
0:39:29.59,0:39:31.39 大多是鹅卵石
0:39:35.69,0:39:38.49 安迪 我们是朋友 对吗?
0:39:39.39,0:39:40.99 我想是的
0:39:41.59,0:39:43.09 我能问你个问题吗?
0:39:44.59,0:39:45.99 你为何要杀你妻子?
0:39:47.29,0:39:48.79 我是清白的 瑞德
0:39:48.99,0:39:51.09 就像这狱中其他人一样
0:39:55.39,0:39:56.99 你怎会进来的?
0:39:59.69,0:40:01.79 和你一样 是谋杀
0:40:02.09,0:40:03.19 清白的?
0:40:05.89,0:40:08.29 肖申克监狱里唯一有罪的一个
0:41:07.69,0:41:09.09 金丝雀在哪里?
0:41:09.39,0:41:10.59 你怎么知道的?
0:41:10.89,0:41:13.19 我怎么知道? 原来你不知道
0:41:13.39,0:41:14.49 来
0:41:16.99,0:41:19.09 金丝雀就在那里
0:41:21.79,0:41:25.09 在我家听到女人唱歌很惊讶是吗?
0:41:28.59,0:41:29.99 那确实令我
0:41:30.99,0:41:32.59 很惊讶
0:41:36.89,0:41:38.29 等等
0:41:38.89,0:41:40.39 她出场了
0:41:40.69,0:41:43.49 我最爱看她摆弄头发那场戏
0:41:43.69,0:41:46.39 我知道 这个月已经看了三遍了
0:41:46.69,0:41:48.59 吉达 你好吗?
0:41:49.59,0:41:50.69 我?
0:41:53.39,0:41:55.19 天啊 我喜欢这场戏
0:42:00.29,0:42:03.29 我明白你什么都弄得到
0:42:04.29,0:42:08.09 是的 要什么有什么 你要什么?
0:42:08.29,0:42:10.39 丽塔·海华丝 什么?
0:42:10.99,0:42:12.29 你能找到她吗?
0:42:13.69,0:42:17.09 你就是强尼吗 久闻大名了
0:42:18.39,0:42:20.69 要几个星期的时间 几个星期?
0:42:20.89,0:42:25.29 很抱歉 现在她又没有坐在我的大腿上
0:42:25.79,0:42:27.19 但我能找到的
0:42:27.39,0:42:28.69 放松些
0:42:30.59,0:42:31.89 谢谢
0:42:52.49,0:42:54.19 滚出去! 我要换带子了
0:42:54.49,0:42:56.39 我说了 滚出去
0:43:02.59,0:43:03.99 你打算大叫吗?
0:43:05.29,0:43:07.19 让我们做个了结吧
0:43:12.29,0:43:14.29 他打爆了我的鼻子
0:43:23.59,0:43:24.79 现在
0:43:25.29,0:43:27.39 我要拉开拉链
0:43:27.69,0:43:30.49 我给你什么吃你就吃下什么
0:43:31.59,0:43:34.19 然后再吃罗斯的 你打爆了他的鼻子
0:43:34.39,0:43:36.59 他该得到点补偿
0:43:36.79,0:43:38.59 我会咬断任何放进我嘴里的东西
0:43:38.79,0:43:41.39 不 你还没明白
0:43:41.79,0:43:44.79 你那样做的话我就把刀插进你的耳朵
0:43:44.99,0:43:48.49 好吧 但你得知道突如其来的脑部撞击
0:43:48.69,0:43:50.59 会令受害人剧烈反应
0:43:50.79,0:43:54.29 事实上 我听说受害者会咬紧牙关
0:43:55.09,0:43:57.59 要用铁棍
0:43:57.79,0:43:59.19 才能撬开他的嘴巴
0:44:02.09,0:44:03.59 你怎么知道的?
0:44:03.89,0:44:05.29 从书里看到的
0:44:06.69,0:44:09.29 你不会看书? 白痴?
0:44:10.99,0:44:12.09 亲爱的
0:44:13.99,0:44:15.79 你不应该这样的
0:44:18.39,0:44:21.29 伯格斯没有把任何东西放进安迪的嘴里
0:44:21.59,0:44:23.69 他的朋友们也没有
0:44:24.09,0:44:27.89 他们只是把他揍了个半死
0:44:28.59,0:44:31.09 安迪在疗养院里整整躺了一个月
0:44:31.89,0:44:34.39 伯格斯则被锁进黑房关了一周
0:44:38.49,0:44:40.09 伯格斯 时间到了
0:44:43.89,0:44:45.49 遵命 头
0:44:48.79,0:44:51.59 回到你的囚仓 等着查房
0:44:51.79,0:44:54.49 所有犯人返回囚房
0:45:09.39,0:45:10.39 什么事?
0:45:23.09,0:45:25.59 他要到哪里去? 抓住他
0:45:31.39,0:45:32.69 救命
0:45:36.39,0:45:38.89 之后 有两件事再也没发生过了
0:45:39.19,0:45:42.29 姐妹花再也不敢惹安迪了
0:45:43.19,0:45:45.69 而伯格斯再也没有站起来
0:45:46.89,0:45:50.39 他被送到一个特殊医院去
0:45:50.59,0:45:53.29 据我所知 他在下半生中
0:45:53.49,0:45:55.39 都只能靠饮筒来进食
0:45:56.39,0:46:00.39 我想给安迪开个欢迎会庆祝他复原
0:46:02.19,0:46:03.79 听起来很不错
0:46:03.99,0:46:06.49 啤酒的事我们还欠他的情
0:46:07.29,0:46:09.49 他喜欢下象棋
0:46:10.09,0:46:11.99 给他找点石头吧
0:46:44.59,0:46:45.79 伙计们
0:46:46.59,0:46:47.59 我找到一块
0:46:47.89,0:46:49.29 我找到一块 看
0:46:51.29,0:46:55.29 希伍德 那不是皂石 也不是石膏
0:46:55.49,0:46:57.59 你们他妈的是地质学家吗?
0:46:57.59,0:46:59.59 他是对的 这不是我们要找的
0:46:59.59,0:47:02.49 - 这到底是什么? - 粪球
0:47:03.39,0:47:05.99 - 胡扯! - 不 是马粪
0:47:05.99,0:47:07.99 晒干了的
0:47:16.49,0:47:17.99 他妈的
0:47:17.99,0:47:22.49 不久 他们开始认识石头
0:47:22.49,0:47:24.39 当安迪在周末回来的时候
0:47:24.69,0:47:28.39 我们已经找到足够多的石头让他忙个不停
0:47:29.19,0:47:31.69 那个星期我也收到很大批货
0:47:31.99,0:47:33.09 香烟
0:47:33.29,0:47:34.29 口香糖
0:47:34.49,0:47:35.99 威土忌
0:47:36.19,0:47:39.59 画着裸女的扑克牌
0:47:39.79,0:47:42.49 当然 最重要的是
0:47:44.39,0:47:46.49 丽塔·海华丝
0:48:09.59,0:48:12.39 "欢迎归来 免费享用"
0:48:23.59,0:48:25.79 注意 要查房了
0:48:26.09,0:48:28.79 注意 要查房了
0:48:29.39,0:48:31.79 119房
0:48:33.69,0:48:35.39 123房
0:48:45.79,0:48:46.59 站起来
0:48:49.29,0:48:50.79 面向墙站好
0:49:24.89,0:49:26.79 转过身面向典狱长
0:49:33.39,0:49:35.49 很高兴看见你在看这本书
0:49:36.79,0:49:38.79 特别喜欢哪一章?
0:49:39.59,0:49:41.99 看到你 就知道
0:49:42.19,0:49:44.39 你是精神之主
0:49:45.59,0:49:47.69 马可福音第十三章三十五节
0:49:48.49,0:49:50.29 我一向都喜欢那一章
0:49:51.29,0:49:52.89 但我更喜欢
0:49:53.39,0:49:55.29 我是世界的光
0:49:55.69,0:49:58.99 跟随我就不会步入黑暗 而能得到生命的光
0:49:59.19,0:50:01.89 约瑟福音第八章第十二节
0:50:02.19,0:50:04.19 我听说你精通数学
0:50:04.39,0:50:05.39 不错
0:50:06.59,0:50:08.59 人总得有一技之长
0:50:11.09,0:50:12.09 这个你怎么解释
0:50:13.29,0:50:17.29 这是纱纸 打磨石头用的
0:50:17.79,0:50:19.69 这是我的小嗜好
0:50:30.59,0:50:31.99 相当干净
0:50:32.29,0:50:35.39 看来没什么古怪的
0:50:39.69,0:50:41.69 这是未经我批准的
0:50:43.39,0:50:44.79 但是
0:50:46.89,0:50:48.89 凡事总有例外
0:50:59.29,0:51:00.59 锁门!
0:51:03.49,0:51:05.09 差点忘记了
0:51:05.49,0:51:07.69 我不能取走它的
0:51:08.39,0:51:10.39 救赎之道就在其中
0:51:10.59,0:51:11.59 是的 先生
0:51:20.19,0:51:22.69 查房其实只是个藉口
0:51:23.19,0:51:24.39 事实上
0:51:24.59,0:51:27.09 诺顿是想考察一下
0:51:34.19,0:51:37.19 "主的审判迅速降临"
0:51:40.79,0:51:43.09 我太太在教堂做的
0:51:45.79,0:51:47.09 很不错 先生
0:51:48.69,0:51:50.09 喜欢洗衣房的工作吗?
0:51:51.79,0:51:53.49 不 先生 不是特别喜欢
0:51:53.79,0:51:56.29 或许我们能做点别的
0:51:56.49,0:51:58.99 利用你的学识
0:52:06.99,0:52:08.49 杰克 布鲁斯呢?
0:52:10.39,0:52:13.09 安迪 我听到你来了
0:52:13.79,0:52:15.39 我来跟你工作
0:52:15.69,0:52:17.99 我知道 他们跟我说了
0:52:18.79,0:52:20.89 也是被踢伤的吗?
0:52:21.09,0:52:23.39 我来带你看看吧
0:52:23.59,0:52:24.79 来吧
0:52:26.19,0:52:27.89 就在这儿
0:52:28.09,0:52:30.09 肖申克监狱图书馆
0:52:30.79,0:52:32.79 《国家地理》
0:52:33.69,0:52:36.49 《读者文摘》
0:52:36.69,0:52:38.29 爱情小说
0:52:38.79,0:52:40.69 杂志
0:52:40.99,0:52:43.29 园艺指南
0:52:43.59,0:52:47.09 每晚我推车四处走
0:52:47.29,0:52:49.89 名字写在这板上
0:52:50.49,0:52:53.19 很容易的工作
0:52:53.89,0:52:56.79 有问题吗? 你当了多久的图书管理员
0:52:57.99,0:53:01.99 我1905年入狱 1912年在此工作
0:53:03.39,0:53:05.49 你一直都有助手吗?
0:53:05.79,0:53:08.19 没有 工作不是那么忙
0:53:08.99,0:53:10.19 那为什么现在让我来?
0:53:10.59,0:53:11.89 我不知道
0:53:12.09,0:53:15.19 但我很高兴有个伴
0:53:26.39,0:53:28.69 就是他
0:53:36.39,0:53:37.49 我叫迪格斯
0:53:37.89,0:53:39.59 我想
0:53:40.19,0:53:44.09 为儿子申请助学金
0:53:47.99,0:53:49.49 我明白了
0:53:54.59,0:53:57.59 坐下来谈好吗?
0:54:00.79,0:54:03.69 布鲁斯 你有纸和笔吗?
0:54:15.09,0:54:16.39 谢谢
0:54:16.99,0:54:18.09 那么
0:54:19.89,0:54:21.59 迪格斯先生
0:54:22.39,0:54:24.49 接着安迪问迪格斯
0:54:24.69,0:54:27.69 你想让你的儿子去哈佛还是耶鲁?
0:54:27.89,0:54:28.99 他没有这样说
0:54:29.39,0:54:31.79 上帝可以作证
0:54:32.09,0:54:33.79 迪格斯愣了一会儿
0:54:34.09,0:54:37.19 傻笑着和安迪握手
0:54:37.59,0:54:39.89 老天!和他握手
0:54:40.09,0:54:42.99 我告诉你们 我感到
0:54:43.19,0:54:47.49 安迪若穿上那套衣服
0:54:47.69,0:54:50.29 他就会变成德福瑞恩先生的了
0:54:50.49,0:54:52.09 安迪 又交上新朋友了?
0:54:53.39,0:54:55.09 我不认为是朋友
0:54:55.29,0:54:59.09 我是一个能提供准确财政计划的谋杀犯
0:54:59.29,0:55:01.69 只是某人不错的仆人
0:55:01.89,0:55:03.69 至少可以令你离开洗衣房
0:55:04.19,0:55:06.09 可能不是那么简单的
0:55:06.39,0:55:09.09 我打算扩大图书馆 找点新书
0:55:09.29,0:55:11.89 还是找张台球桌吧
0:55:13.59,0:55:16.59 你打算怎么做 我是说
0:55:16.79,0:55:19.69 怎么得到新书 向谁请求
0:55:20.19,0:55:22.29 我会向典狱长要钱
0:55:23.09,0:55:27.39 噢 孩子 孩子 我经历了六个典狱长 懂得了一条
0:55:27.59,0:55:29.89 一个事实 宇宙真理
0:55:30.19,0:55:31.59 那个人还没有生出来
0:55:31.79,0:55:36.69 你向他们提出定遭拒绝的
0:55:37.59,0:55:40.49 - 预算不够用 - 我知道
0:55:40.69,0:55:44.09 或许我写信向参议员提出
0:55:44.29,0:55:48.29 只有三种情况能动纳税人的钱
0:55:48.59,0:55:51.09 多建围墙、多建牢房和增加守卫
0:55:51.29,0:55:53.89 若你批准 我想尝试一下 每周一封信
0:55:54.09,0:55:56.89 - 他们不能永不理会 - 当然能够
0:55:57.09,0:55:59.79 如果你写着高兴那就写吧
0:56:00.09,0:56:02.69 我来替你寄出 怎样?
0:56:04.39,0:56:07.19 就这样 安迪开始每周写一封信
0:56:07.39,0:56:08.99 就像他说得那样
0:56:13.19,0:56:15.79 但如诺顿所说
0:56:15.99,0:56:17.49 一直都无回覆
0:56:25.69,0:56:30.59 过了四月 安迪已帮半数狱警们报税
0:56:31.89,0:56:34.39 后来 全都找他帮忙了
0:56:34.39,0:56:36.29 连典狱长纳税务都由他处理
0:56:38.09,0:56:41.49 后来 他们安排
0:56:41.79,0:56:44.19 球队在税季中比赛
0:56:45.79,0:56:50.19 所有的球队都带着报税表
0:56:50.39,0:56:51.79 所以莫尔斯比监狱
0:56:51.99,0:56:54.19 配给你一支枪 但要你自己付钱
0:56:54.49,0:56:56.19 对 连手枪皮套也是
0:56:56.39,0:56:58.79 那可以减免税款 你可把它记下来
0:56:58.99,0:57:02.09 是的!安迪就像一个正常的会计师
0:57:02.79,0:57:07.29 事实上 在税季中他如此的忙 允许有一个帮手
0:57:07.49,0:57:09.99 瑞德 你可以取1040号表格来吗?
0:57:10.19,0:57:14.99 每年有一个月离开监狱去木工场做工
0:57:16.29,0:57:19.39 同时 安迪仍旧不断的写信
0:57:24.89,0:57:27.29 瑞德、安迪 布鲁斯出事了
0:57:28.39,0:57:29.89 看着门
0:57:30.09,0:57:31.49 冷静点 布鲁斯
0:57:31.69,0:57:33.49 千万别冲动 放下来!
0:57:33.99,0:57:36.59 - 放下来 该死! - 发生什么事?
0:57:36.79,0:57:39.39 前一秒还好好的 他突然掏出刀来
0:57:39.59,0:57:41.39 有事慢慢商量好吗?
0:57:41.59,0:57:45.39 没商量余地的 我要割断他的喉咙
0:57:45.59,0:57:47.39 他有什么对不起你?
0:57:47.59,0:57:49.19 去问狱警吧
0:57:49.79,0:57:50.99 我别无选择
0:57:51.49,0:57:53.79 我们都知道 你不会伤害海伍德的
0:57:53.99,0:57:56.49 - 对吗 海伍德? - 是的
0:57:56.69,0:57:59.99 他是你的朋友 布鲁斯是讲道理的
0:58:00.29,0:58:01.39 对吗?
0:58:02.29,0:58:04.89 那么把刀放下 看着我
0:58:05.09,0:58:07.29 把刀放下
0:58:09.29,0:58:11.39 看看他的脖子
0:58:12.09,0:58:14.39 看看他的脖子 他在流血
0:58:15.29,0:58:16.79 这是唯一
0:58:16.99,0:58:19.09 使我留在这里的办法
0:58:19.29,0:58:21.69 你疯了 你不会这样做的
0:58:21.99,0:58:23.99 放下 放下刀
0:58:32.79,0:58:34.29 放松
0:58:34.99,0:58:36.49 一切都会好的
0:58:37.59,0:58:39.19 他?那么我呢?
0:58:39.39,0:58:41.79 这个愚蠢的疯子差点割断我的喉咙
0:58:41.99,0:58:43.89 你就连刮胡子也比这刮得厉害
0:58:44.09,0:58:46.19 究竟怎么会这样?
0:58:46.39,0:58:48.59 没什么 我只是进来和他道别
0:58:49.19,0:58:51.89 难到你没听说?他获得假释
0:58:54.19,0:58:56.99 我就是不明白 发生什么了
0:58:57.19,0:58:59.99 老家伙疯了
0:59:00.19,0:59:02.09 够了
0:59:02.29,0:59:05.09 - 我听说你吓得尿流 - 去你妈的
0:59:05.29,0:59:06.49 不要说了!
0:59:07.49,0:59:08.89 布鲁斯不是疯了
0:59:12.79,0:59:14.49 他只是被体制化了
0:59:15.89,0:59:17.79 体制化?什么东西?
0:59:17.99,0:59:21.99 他在此已有五十年了 海伍德 五十年!
0:59:22.19,0:59:23.99 这是他唯一认识的地方
0:59:24.19,0:59:26.49 在这儿 他是个重要的人
0:59:26.69,0:59:27.79 一个有教养的人
0:59:28.59,0:59:30.49 在外面 他什么都不是
0:59:31.39,0:59:33.79 只是一个假释出来的囚犯
0:59:33.79,0:59:38.09 申请张借书证都有困难
0:59:38.39,0:59:40.09 你明白我说的话吗?
0:59:40.39,0:59:43.29 瑞德 我相信你说是屁话
0:59:44.49,0:59:46.79 怎么想随你吧
0:59:47.39,0:59:49.79 我告诉你 这些围墙很有趣的
0:59:51.39,0:59:52.99 开始 你痛恨周围的高墙
0:59:54.89,0:59:56.79 慢慢的 你习惯生活在其中
0:59:58.69,1:00:00.69 时间久了
1:00:01.39,1:00:03.39 你不得不依靠它而生存
1:00:04.39,1:00:06.59 那就是被体制化了
1:00:08.29,1:00:11.09 我永远不会那样的 对吗?
1:00:11.89,1:00:14.39 因为你没布鲁斯那样长时间在此
1:00:14.69,1:00:16.19 太对了
1:00:18.79,1:00:20.69 他们把你送到这里来生活
1:00:21.39,1:00:23.69 这就是他们确实想要做的
1:00:25.49,1:00:27.49 无论怎样已经部分达到了
1:00:35.09,1:00:37.99 我不能再照顾你了 杰克
1:00:39.19,1:00:40.79 你走吧
1:00:42.09,1:00:43.59 你自由了
1:00:44.89,1:00:46.39 你自由了
1:01:05.39,1:01:07.09 布鲁斯 祝你好运
1:01:45.09,1:01:46.59 大家好
1:01:46.89,1:01:50.89 外面的改变令我难以想像
1:01:52.39,1:01:54.99 老头 找死啊?
1:01:56.29,1:01:59.79 我童年时只见过一次汽车
1:02:00.39,1:02:02.79 但现在到处都是
1:02:06.49,1:02:10.79 世界在一片巨大的忙碌之中
1:02:26.59,1:02:30.39 假释委员会给我安排了中途宿舍
1:02:30.69,1:02:32.39 叫做"酿酒人"
1:02:32.59,1:02:33.69 和一份工作
1:02:33.89,1:02:36.89 在一家杂货店里包装食物
1:02:38.39,1:02:40.89 虽然很辛苦 但我很努力工作
1:02:41.09,1:02:43.39 我的手经常感到酸痛
1:02:43.69,1:02:45.69 记得用两层袋
1:02:45.89,1:02:47.89 上次几乎穿底了
1:02:48.59,1:02:51.59 听到那女士说的吗?
1:02:51.79,1:02:53.09 是的 先生
1:02:53.29,1:02:56.79 我想那店主不太喜欢我
1:02:59.89,1:03:04.19 有时工作完后 我到公园里去喂那些鸽子
1:03:04.59,1:03:06.09 我一直希望
1:03:06.29,1:03:09.69 杰克会飞来和我打招呼
1:03:10.29,1:03:12.29 但它从未来过
1:03:13.49,1:03:18.29 我希望 不管在哪 它都过的很好 又交到新朋友
1:03:21.99,1:03:24.69 晚上我不能入睡
1:03:24.99,1:03:28.29 经常作恶梦 身体像一直往下掉
1:03:28.49,1:03:30.79 醒来时感到恐惧
1:03:30.99,1:03:34.99 要想一会儿才知道自己在哪儿
1:03:36.69,1:03:41.59 也许我该用枪打劫 让他们好送我回家
1:03:41.89,1:03:46.19 我可以打死那个店主 当作额外补助
1:03:47.89,1:03:51.89 但我已经太老了 再也干不了这种蠢事
1:03:52.09,1:03:53.89 我不喜欢这地方
1:03:54.09,1:03:58.09 它令我感到害怕 我决定
1:03:58.89,1:04:00.59 离开
1:04:11.49,1:04:14.09 我怀疑他们会争论
1:04:14.29,1:04:17.79 但不是为我这个老坏蛋
1:05:05.09,1:05:08.89 "老布来此一游"
1:05:20.19,1:05:24.49 我怀疑他们会争论 但不是为我这种老坏蛋
1:05:25.49,1:05:29.39 另外 跟海伍德说 上次的事很对不起
1:05:29.59,1:05:31.89 不再有痛苦的感觉了 布鲁斯
1:05:42.39,1:05:44.39 他应该死在这儿
1:05:49.89,1:05:51.29 你该死的做了什么?
1:05:51.49,1:05:54.19 一团糟 我来告诉你
1:05:59.69,1:06:03.39 这些都是什么? 你告诉我 全都寄给你的
1:06:04.69,1:06:05.99 拿着
1:06:14.59,1:06:16.09 亲爱的德弗瑞恩先生
1:06:17.19,1:06:19.19 应你的来信请求 州政府拨给
1:06:19.39,1:06:23.69 你的图书馆计划经费
1:06:24.39,1:06:26.29 这是200元
1:06:26.49,1:06:30.49 而州立图书馆
1:06:30.69,1:06:33.19 捐出旧书和日常用品
1:06:33.39,1:06:37.39 这些应是你所需要的 而此事亦告一段落
1:06:37.79,1:06:39.59 恳请阁下勿再来信
1:06:39.79,1:06:42.49 典狱长回来前要清理好
1:06:42.69,1:06:43.89 知道
1:06:48.19,1:06:49.29 安迪 真不错
1:06:52.29,1:06:53.39 哦!
1:06:54.59,1:06:56.59 只用了六年时间
1:06:58.09,1:07:00.89 由现在起 我每星期写两封信
1:07:01.09,1:07:04.39 你真的很疯狂 把这儿清理干净
1:07:04.69,1:07:05.49 照他说的办
1:07:05.69,1:07:07.09 我去厕所
1:07:07.29,1:07:08.79 回来时
1:07:08.99,1:07:10.69 不想见到这些书
1:07:47.73,1:07:50.39 {\\3c&HFF8000&}莫扎特的中伯爵夫人\N和苏珊娜的二重唱{\r}
1:07:51.90,1:07:54.44 ∮ 大意  微风轻吹…
1:07:59.49,1:08:00.19 安迪 听到了吗?
1:08:00.61,1:08:04.28 ∮ 希望能够吹起柔柔的西风…
1:08:16.55,1:08:24.34 ∮ 西风…
1:08:54.79,1:08:59.09 ∮ 今晚会有风吧…
1:08:59.17,1:09:04.34 ∮ 今晚 …
1:09:05.89,1:09:08.26 ∮ 在林中松树的下面…
1:09:09.59,1:09:10.79 德弗瑞恩!
1:09:13.29,1:09:14.89 安迪 让我出去
1:09:21.69,1:09:26.69 我到今天也没不明白 这两个意大利女人在唱着什么
1:09:26.99,1:09:29.19 事实上 我也不想去明白
1:09:29.39,1:09:31.89 有些东西不说更好
1:09:35.49,1:09:38.19 我想那是 如此的美
1:09:38.39,1:09:40.59 无法用语言来形容
1:09:40.79,1:09:43.69 美得让你心痛
1:09:45.29,1:09:47.79 我告诉你 那声音飞翔
1:09:48.09,1:09:52.39 比在这个灰暗地方的任何一个人梦想的都要高远
1:09:52.59,1:09:55.99 像一只美丽的小鸟 飞进了我们这灰色的鸟笼
1:09:56.19,1:09:58.89 让这些围墙消失了
1:09:59.39,1:10:01.59 在那一刻
1:10:01.79,1:10:04.79 每个在肖申克的落伍者 感到了的自由
1:10:07.39,1:10:09.99 但那令典狱长极度愤怒
1:10:11.29,1:10:12.29 开门
1:10:15.19,1:10:16.99 开门!
1:10:18.29,1:10:20.99 德弗瑞恩 开门
1:10:22.39,1:10:23.59 把它关掉!
1:10:30.59,1:10:33.09 我警告你 德弗瑞恩!把它关掉
1:10:50.79,1:10:52.39 你落到我手里了
1:10:59.79,1:11:02.99 安迪被关禁闭两周
1:11:03.19,1:11:04.79 站起来
1:11:05.99,1:11:08.39 - 看看谁回来了 - 大艺术家!
1:11:10.19,1:11:13.79 你就不能放些好听的吗 嗯? 比如汉克.威廉姆斯!
1:11:14.19,1:11:16.99 还没来得及接受点播 他们就破门进来了
1:11:17.19,1:11:20.29 - 被关了两周 值得吗? - 那是我最好的时光
1:11:20.49,1:11:24.49 没有被关小号容易过的事 那个地方一个星期就像一年
1:11:24.89,1:11:28.19 对 我有莫扎特先生陪我
1:11:28.39,1:11:31.39 他们让你带留声机到那儿?
1:11:33.79,1:11:35.19 它就在这儿
1:11:35.99,1:11:37.29 在这儿
1:11:38.39,1:11:40.49 这就是音乐的魅力 他们
1:11:40.69,1:11:42.99 不能把它从你这儿夺走
1:11:46.59,1:11:48.99 你们从没此感觉吗?
1:11:50.79,1:11:53.89 我年轻时曾学过吹口琴
1:11:54.89,1:11:56.29 可是 现在已经失去兴趣了
1:11:56.29,1:11:58.19 因为在这里没有任何意义
1:11:58.19,1:12:00.59 这里才是它最有意义的地方
1:12:00.59,1:12:03.09 你需要它就不会忘记它
1:12:03.09,1:12:04.59 忘记?
1:12:04.59,1:12:07.79 忘记有一些...
1:12:07.79,1:12:10.19 地方
1:12:10.69,1:12:14.59 在这个世界上 不是用石头围成
1:12:15.59,1:12:17.09 有些东西
1:12:17.39,1:12:19.09 在内心
1:12:19.09,1:12:21.29 不能到达
1:12:21.29,1:12:22.59 不能触摸
1:12:23.19,1:12:24.59 属于你
1:12:26.09,1:12:27.69 你在说什么?
1:12:28.79,1:12:29.99 希望
1:12:31.09,1:12:32.39 希望
1:12:34.29,1:12:36.29 我告诉你 我的朋友
1:12:37.09,1:12:39.39 希望是很危险的东西
1:12:40.59,1:12:42.89 希望会让人疯狂
1:12:43.69,1:12:45.79 它在这儿没用
1:12:45.99,1:12:48.19 你最好习惯这想法
1:12:50.69,1:12:52.19 就像布鲁斯?
1:13:17.59,1:13:18.59 坐下
1:13:23.89,1:13:27.19 你因终身监禁在此三十年
1:13:28.39,1:13:30.39 觉得自己被改造了吗?
1:13:30.69,1:13:31.89 是的 先生
1:13:33.19,1:13:34.49 毫无疑问
1:13:35.69,1:13:38.09 老实说我己改过
1:13:40.09,1:13:41.99 我已不会危害社会
1:13:42.49,1:13:44.09 上帝可以作证
1:13:46.59,1:13:48.69 真的改变了
1:13:52.89,1:13:54.19 "不合格"
1:13:58.69,1:13:59.99 三十年
1:14:01.99,1:14:03.89 当你这样说时
1:14:04.79,1:14:06.59 想过是怎样过的吗?
1:14:08.99,1:14:11.19 我在想十年是怎样过去的
1:14:16.19,1:14:17.19 这儿
1:14:17.59,1:14:20.39 这是庆祝你假释被拒绝的礼物
1:14:21.59,1:14:23.29 打来看看吧
1:14:24.39,1:14:26.49 跟你的竞争对手买的
1:14:26.69,1:14:29.79 别介意 我想让它给你一个惊喜
1:14:39.89,1:14:41.29 它真漂亮
1:14:43.09,1:14:44.29 谢谢你
1:14:46.79,1:14:48.29 你会用它来吹奏吗?
1:14:52.89,1:14:54.09 不
1:14:57.69,1:14:59.09 不会是现在
1:15:16.79,1:15:17.89 关上!
1:15:31.14,1:15:34.29 "这个新女孩给你纪念十周年 瑞德赠"
1:15:54.09,1:15:55.39 熄灯
1:16:29.99,1:16:32.09 安迪说到做到
1:16:32.49,1:16:35.19 他每周写两封信
1:16:37.29,1:16:41.29 1959年 州议员最后终于面对现实
1:16:41.59,1:16:44.79 那200元的支票起不了作用
1:16:44.99,1:16:49.29 最后通过每年拨款500元
1:16:49.49,1:16:51.39 来让他闭嘴
1:16:51.59,1:16:54.59 随后安迪所说的令你感到更意外
1:16:54.79,1:16:57.69 他与书友俱乐部 慈善团体谈妥
1:16:57.89,1:17:00.69 他用剩下来的钱来买书
1:17:01.19,1:17:02.69 《金银岛》
1:17:03.29,1:17:04.59 罗伯特·路易斯
1:17:04.79,1:17:05.79 斯蒂文森
1:17:05.99,1:17:07.39 科幻类 冒险类
1:17:09.99,1:17:10.99 下一本是什么?
1:17:11.19,1:17:14.29 是汽车修理
1:17:14.99,1:17:16.19 和肥皂雕刻技术
1:17:16.39,1:17:19.59 技术与爱好 教育性那一栏
1:17:19.79,1:17:21.69 《基督山伯爵》
1:17:22.19,1:17:24.49 那书不值一看
1:17:25.59,1:17:26.49 作者是亚历山大
1:17:26.99,1:17:28.29 大仲马
1:17:28.59,1:17:29.69 "笨蛋"
1:17:31.99,1:17:32.99 "笨蛋"?
1:17:35.89,1:17:37.89 大仲马 知道那是什么故事吗?
1:17:40.19,1:17:42.09 讲越狱的 你喜欢看的
1:17:42.29,1:17:46.19 那我觉得应该发到"教育类" 对吧?
1:17:47.09,1:17:51.09 我们其余的随时尽可能帮忙
1:17:51.79,1:17:53.49 到了肯尼迪遇刺那一年
1:17:53.79,1:17:58.29 安迪把一个充满松脂味的储藏间
1:17:53.79,1:17:57.00 {\fs14\an5\3c&HFF8000&}布鲁斯·哈特伦纪念图书馆
1:17:58.59,1:18:01.69 变成了新英格兰州最好的的监狱图书馆
1:18:02.39,1:18:05.09 那里有最好的汉克威廉姆斯唱片集
1:18:05.18,1:18:09.35 ∮ 我真是不知所措
1:18:09.43,1:18:12.18 ∮ 每天除了傻傻地呆坐和叹气
1:18:12.69,1:18:14.59 那也是诺顿典狱长发展大计的一年
1:18:14.79,1:18:17.79 推广他著名的"内在改造"计划
1:18:18.19,1:18:20.29 你可能从报纸上读到过
1:18:20.49,1:18:23.59 所有的媒体都刊出他的照片
1:18:23.79,1:18:25.09 这不是放任的方式
1:18:25.39,1:18:28.59 而是一种真正的进步
1:18:28.79,1:18:31.29 让犯人恢复道德
1:18:31.59,1:18:34.09 收容人被适当的监督
1:18:34.39,1:18:36.99 使他们能在外面工作
1:18:37.19,1:18:40.49 为大众服务
1:18:40.49,1:18:42.99 他们会懂得劳动的价值
1:18:42.99,1:18:46.99 为社会服务的诚实劳动
1:18:46.99,1:18:52.19 在最低耗支情况下 来利用纳税人的金钱
1:18:52.59,1:18:54.89 当然 诺顿没有跟报界说
1:18:55.09,1:18:58.59 "最低耗支"其实是相当不确切的说法
1:18:58.79,1:19:01.79 有很多办法能瞒天过海的
1:19:02.09,1:19:04.49 人力 物力 你说多少就多少
1:19:04.89,1:19:07.79 上帝 钱是这样滚入!
1:19:07.99,1:19:10.49 继续这样 我不用干了
1:19:10.69,1:19:15.19 有这些劳工 你可比这镇上的承包商出更低价
1:19:15.69,1:19:18.69 我们提供有用的社区劳务
1:19:18.89,1:19:22.59 对报界来说很动听 但我要养家活口的
1:19:25.19,1:19:26.79 我们走得太远
1:19:28.09,1:19:32.99 我需要这份公路的合同 如果拿不到我就完了
1:19:33.89,1:19:37.69 尝尝我的妻子给你特制的陷饼吧
1:19:37.99,1:19:39.29 好好考虑一下
1:19:47.59,1:19:50.29 如果我是你对此合同并不担心
1:19:50.49,1:19:53.59 我已把人手派至别处
1:19:55.49,1:19:58.59 谢谢你太太的糕饼
1:19:59.69,1:20:01.89 每笔暗盘交易下
1:20:02.19,1:20:04.79 赚来的每一分钱
1:20:05.09,1:20:08.19 都是由安迪来作记录的
1:20:08.59,1:20:09.79 两笔存款
1:20:10.09,1:20:14.09 文尼国际和新格兰 一天又过去了
1:20:44.39,1:20:45.90 把我的东西拿到洗衣房
1:20:46.00,1:20:48.79 把两套衣服要干洗的 还有一袋这样的
1:20:49.19,1:20:52.79 如果他们再把我的衬衫浆过了头 有他们好受的
1:20:52.99,1:20:54.29 我看上去怎么样?
1:20:55.29,1:20:57.79 - 很不错 - 这是盛大的慈善晚会
1:20:57.99,1:20:59.59 州长也会出席
1:21:00.99,1:21:02.39 你要剩下的这些吗?
1:21:03.79,1:21:05.69 烤的太难吃
1:21:06.89,1:21:08.29 谢谢 长官
1:21:11.09,1:21:14.29 我听说这样的派 他收了不少
1:21:14.59,1:21:19.39 他有你想象不到的手段 回扣、酬金..
1:21:19.59,1:21:21.99 黑钱像河一样流过这里
1:21:22.19,1:21:25.99 但他迟早得解释钱是从何而来的
1:21:26.19,1:21:27.99 这就是我牵涉其中的原因
1:21:28.59,1:21:30.89 我安排了一切来过滤
1:21:31.09,1:21:33.89 股票、债券、市政免税
1:21:34.19,1:21:37.79 我把钱送到外面 等它们回来的时候
1:21:37.99,1:21:40.89 - 纯洁得就像个处女 - 像洗衣机
1:21:41.49,1:21:45.09 到诺顿退休的时候 我已让他成为百万富翁了
1:21:47.49,1:21:49.29 如果被他们抓住的话
1:21:49.29,1:21:51.29 他将在自己的监狱穿上这样的号码服
1:21:52.09,1:21:54.79 看来你对我没有信心
1:21:54.99,1:21:57.99 我知道你很能干 但是总会蛛丝马迹留下
1:21:58.19,1:22:01.59 只要有人想细查 FBI 国税局
1:22:01.79,1:22:02.79 不管怎样...
1:22:03.29,1:22:04.59 总会有人被牵扯
1:22:04.79,1:22:08.59 是的 但不会是我 也不会是典狱长
1:22:12.99,1:22:13.99 那会是谁?
1:22:14.19,1:22:15.79 兰度·史蒂文
1:22:16.29,1:22:17.29 谁?
1:22:17.49,1:22:19.49 从不出声的拍档
1:22:19.69,1:22:22.69 他是帐户的持有者 他才有罪
1:22:22.99,1:22:25.09 他那里是过滤黑钱过程的起点
1:22:25.29,1:22:28.19 不管他们如何调查 都只会查到他
1:22:28.79,1:22:29.99 他是什么人?
1:22:30.19,1:22:34.19 他是一个幻影 幽灵 是兔子哈维的第二个表弟
1:22:35.29,1:22:36.49 我凭空...
1:22:36.69,1:22:37.99 造出他来
1:22:38.79,1:22:41.59 他只存在于文件中罢了
1:22:44.59,1:22:46.99 你不能只这么捏造一个人
1:22:47.19,1:22:50.29 当然可以 如果你知道我们社会系统的漏洞
1:22:50.79,1:22:53.59 吃惊的是邮政就能帮你做到
1:22:53.99,1:22:56.59 史蒂文先生有出生证明书
1:22:56.79,1:22:58.89 驾驶执照和社会编号
1:22:59.19,1:23:00.19 你在说笑
1:23:00.39,1:23:03.79 他们追查帐户的话 只是在追查
1:23:03.99,1:23:05.69 我幻想出来的人
1:23:05.89,1:23:07.89 喔 该死
1:23:09.29,1:23:10.99 我没说过你很能干吗?
1:23:11.39,1:23:12.99 该死 你简直是伦勃朗
1:23:13.69,1:23:15.49 有趣的是
1:23:15.69,1:23:19.69 在外面 我是个诚实的人 正直得像杆直箭
1:23:20.19,1:23:22.49 变成骗子就不得不到监狱里来
1:23:31.39,1:23:32.69 你担心过吗?
1:23:34.09,1:23:37.19 我没参与 我只是处理收益
1:23:37.49,1:23:39.49 一条好的分界线 也许吧
1:23:39.99,1:23:42.09 不过我也建起了图书馆
1:23:42.29,1:23:45.29 来帮助囚犯取得高中文凭
1:23:45.49,1:23:47.79 你可知他会何会让我做所有这些?
1:23:47.99,1:23:50.19 让你开心 好帮他"清洗"
1:23:50.39,1:23:51.79 洗的是钱而非床单
1:23:52.19,1:23:54.79 让我工作轻松 那是交易
1:24:12.09,1:24:14.69 汤姆·威廉姆斯1965年到肖申克监狱服刑
1:24:14.89,1:24:17.19 因非法入室行窃 被判两年监禁
1:24:17.39,1:24:19.69 那是对私人的非法入侵
1:24:19.99,1:24:23.99 警察在佩妮家后门抓到 他在电视旁鬼鬼祟祟的
1:24:24.69,1:24:25.99 年轻的朋克
1:24:26.19,1:24:27.79 "摇滚"先生
1:24:27.99,1:24:29.49 过于自大
1:24:29.69,1:24:32.09 快点 老家伙们 慢得跟糖浆一样
1:24:32.39,1:24:34.09 我干着急
1:24:34.39,1:24:36.09 我们马上就喜欢上他了
1:24:36.39,1:24:40.09 我从后门出来 像这样捧着电视机
1:24:40.39,1:24:44.09 一件大的老家伙 我都看不到了 然后我听到...
1:24:44.69,1:24:46.69 别动 举起手来!
1:24:46.89,1:24:51.49 我站在那里 捧着电视机 他又说:
1:24:51.49,1:24:55.49 "你听到我说的吗?" 我说 "是的 先生"
1:24:55.49,1:24:59.89 但我掉落东西 你会告我毁坏他人财物
1:25:03.49,1:25:06.29 你曾在卡士文服刑 是吗?
1:25:06.29,1:25:10.29 是的 那儿要好过得多
1:25:10.49,1:25:13.29 周末有休假 工作也很有计划
1:25:13.89,1:25:14.79 不像这里 看来你在新英格兰都呆在车里
1:25:16.79,1:25:19.39 我十三岁出道 哪里都去过
1:25:19.39,1:25:21.79 说说看 也许我也去过那里
1:25:21.79,1:25:24.49 也许你应转行了
1:25:25.89,1:25:27.49 我是说
1:25:27.79,1:25:31.19 你不是个一流的小偷 你该试试别的
1:25:31.49,1:25:34.69 是吗?你以为你懂这个?
1:25:35.09,1:25:36.69 你怎会进来的?
1:25:36.99,1:25:37.99 我吗?
1:25:40.39,1:25:42.09 律师坑了我
1:25:45.99,1:25:48.99 这儿所有人都是无辜的 你不知道吗?
1:25:56.89,1:26:01.29 后来知道 汤姆竟然有妻子和刚出生的女儿
1:26:01.79,1:26:03.99 也许他想到她们在街上流荡
1:26:04.19,1:26:06.69 孩子长大却不知道父亲是谁
1:26:06.99,1:26:08.29 不管为什么 总之
1:26:08.69,1:26:11.09 他竟努力起来了
1:26:14.99,1:26:17.79 我想考取高校文凭
1:26:17.99,1:26:20.49 听说你已经帮了很多人了
1:26:21.89,1:26:24.09 我不会在失败者身上浪费时间的
1:26:25.49,1:26:27.99 我再也不是失败者了
1:26:29.79,1:26:31.59 - 你当真? - 是
1:26:33.29,1:26:34.69 你真的是认真的?
1:26:35.69,1:26:37.09 是的 先生 绝对是真的
1:26:37.29,1:26:39.29 好 因为我们要做就要
1:26:39.49,1:26:43.39 有始有终 绝对不能半途而废
1:26:43.69,1:26:45.49 问题是
1:26:46.79,1:26:48.29 我识字不多
1:26:49.49,1:26:50.49 好吧
1:26:52.59,1:26:54.29 你不识字
1:26:54.49,1:26:55.99 就这样
1:26:58.39,1:26:59.89 我们就由它开始
1:27:04.29,1:27:06.49 就这样 安迪开始给汤姆上课
1:27:06.69,1:27:09.29 从最基础的字母开始教
1:27:11.39,1:27:13.59 汤姆学得很快
1:27:13.89,1:27:16.69 从不知道自己的聪明
1:27:18.99,1:27:22.49 没过多久 安迪开始教他课程内容
1:27:22.69,1:27:24.29 他很喜欢这个孩子
1:27:24.49,1:27:28.09 帮一个孩子上进让他很快乐
1:27:28.59,1:27:30.89 但那不是唯一的原因
1:27:31.59,1:27:33.79 监狱里的日子很缓慢
1:27:34.19,1:27:36.79 要用某些事情来消磨时间
1:27:37.19,1:27:39.19 有人收集邮票
1:27:39.59,1:27:42.09 有人收集火柴盒
1:27:42.69,1:27:45.39 安迪建起了图书馆
1:27:45.89,1:27:47.79 现在他需要新的计划
1:27:48.69,1:27:50.19 那就是汤姆
1:27:50.79,1:27:54.79 那和他多年来雕磨石头的原因一样
1:27:55.39,1:27:58.59 也如同他把美女的画像挂在墙上的原因
1:27:59.49,1:28:00.79 在监狱里
1:28:00.99,1:28:04.79 一个人不能让心里空着
1:28:05.49,1:28:10.39 在1966年 汤姆刚要参加考试的时候
1:28:10.59,1:28:12.79 可爱的瑞奎尔出现了
1:28:29.39,1:28:30.39 时间到
1:28:36.39,1:28:37.39 好了吗?
1:28:38.99,1:28:41.19 真的是一团糟
1:28:41.69,1:28:44.49 我白花了一年时间在这狗屎上面
1:28:44.69,1:28:46.19 也许没有你想的那么糟
1:28:46.39,1:28:50.39 比我想像中的还要糟 就像在考中文
1:28:50.79,1:28:52.59 看看你得了多少分?
1:28:52.79,1:28:55.69 我来告诉你吧
1:28:57.69,1:28:58.99 两分
1:28:59.19,1:29:00.79 那就是你该死的考试
1:29:01.09,1:29:04.69 什么猫爬上树 5乘以5是25
1:29:05.69,1:29:07.29 去死吧
1:29:07.59,1:29:08.69 他妈的
1:29:27.79,1:29:29.09 我感觉很差
1:29:29.29,1:29:30.49 我令他失望了
1:29:30.69,1:29:32.39 不是这样 孩子
1:29:32.69,1:29:33.99 他以你为荣
1:29:34.29,1:29:37.19 我跟他是老朋友 我很清楚他的性格
1:29:37.39,1:29:38.89 聪明的伙伴 不是吗?
1:29:39.19,1:29:42.29 就像刚进来时一样聪明 他以前是个银行家
1:29:42.49,1:29:44.69 他为什么被抓进来?
1:29:45.09,1:29:45.99 谋杀
1:29:47.49,1:29:48.89 你说什么?
1:29:50.99,1:29:53.29 人不可以貌相
1:29:54.59,1:29:57.29 在床上捉到妻子和一个高尔夫选手
1:29:57.30,1:29:58.59 把他们两个一起解决了
1:30:06.69,1:30:07.69 怎么了?
1:30:08.99,1:30:11.59 大约四年前
1:30:11.89,1:30:15.09 我在汤玛斯狱服刑
1:30:15.59,1:30:17.29 我偷了一辆车
1:30:17.29,1:30:19.79 这是很不应该的事
1:30:19.89,1:30:22.19 在出狱前六个月
1:30:22.49,1:30:24.39 我有了个新同房
1:30:25.09,1:30:26.69 艾马·布莱奇
1:30:27.39,1:30:28.69 一个强壮、暴躁的混蛋
1:30:29.59,1:30:33.09 人见人憎的那种 明白我的意思吗?
1:30:33.29,1:30:35.99 刑期是六到十二年 持械抢劫
1:30:36.29,1:30:38.59 他说自己犯了不少案子
1:30:38.79,1:30:40.69 难以相信 他很容易激动
1:30:40.70,1:30:43.69 你放个屁 他就暴跳如雷
1:30:44.79,1:30:49.39 整天说个不停 从不闭嘴
1:30:49.59,1:30:51.29 他谈他去过的地方
1:30:51.59,1:30:54.59 他干过的案子 上过的女人
1:30:54.89,1:30:57.09 和他杀的人
1:30:58.29,1:31:01.09 那些让他不爽的人
1:31:01.69,1:31:03.29 他是这么说的
1:31:05.89,1:31:07.99 有天晚上 我开玩笑的说
1:31:09.09,1:31:12.59 我问他 艾马 你杀了谁?
1:31:12.79,1:31:13.89 他说
1:31:14.09,1:31:18.09 有次我在乡村俱乐部打工
1:31:18.79,1:31:22.69 看到来的人都非富则贵
1:31:24.79,1:31:26.79 所以我选了一个家伙
1:31:27.69,1:31:29.19 有天晚上到他家里去
1:31:29.39,1:31:31.19 抢劫东西
1:31:32.59,1:31:33.89 他醒过来
1:31:34.69,1:31:36.39 令我很不爽
1:31:37.49,1:31:39.19 所以我杀了他
1:31:40.89,1:31:43.79 他和他的情妇
1:31:45.19,1:31:47.39 那是最精彩的部分
1:31:48.09,1:31:50.59 她在和这个职业高尔夫球手做爱
1:31:50.79,1:31:53.79 但她是个有夫之妇
1:31:54.49,1:31:56.99 她丈夫是个银行家
1:31:58.49,1:32:00.99 而他竟成了替罪羊
1:32:12.39,1:32:16.29 这是我听过的最震惊的故事
1:32:17.59,1:32:20.09 更让我吃惊的是 你竟然相信了它
1:32:20.79,1:32:21.79 先生?
1:32:23.99,1:32:27.59 很明显威廉姆斯很喜欢你
1:32:28.19,1:32:32.19 他知道你的事后想让你振作起来
1:32:32.39,1:32:34.49 他还年轻 不怎么明事理
1:32:35.09,1:32:38.49 他根本不明白这对你意味着什么 这并不奇怪
1:32:38.89,1:32:40.49 狱长 他讲的是事实
1:32:41.19,1:32:45.19 就说这个 如果有布莱奇这个人的话
1:32:45.69,1:32:50.29 你认为他会跪下来 哭着说"是我做的 我坦白"
1:32:50.49,1:32:53.19 方便的话 给我加个终身监禁吧
1:32:53.39,1:32:56.19 但是汤姆的证供能让我的案子重审
1:32:56.39,1:32:58.89 前提是布莱奇在那狱中
1:32:59.09,1:33:01.09 也许他现在已经获释了
1:33:01.29,1:33:03.69 他们应该有他的住址的
1:33:03.89,1:33:05.89 这是个机会 对吗?
1:33:08.19,1:33:09.89 你怎会这么愚蠢?
1:33:10.89,1:33:11.89 什么?
1:33:13.39,1:33:14.79 你说什么?
1:33:14.99,1:33:16.79 愚蠢 这是故意说的?
1:33:17.09,1:33:18.59 你忘记你自己的身份了
1:33:18.99,1:33:21.89 俱乐部会有他的工作记录卡的记录
1:33:22.09,1:33:24.89 和有他名字的报税表
1:33:25.09,1:33:27.79 你要继续幻想的话 那是你的事
1:33:27.99,1:33:30.59 不要影响我 谈话结束
1:33:30.79,1:33:33.39 如果我能出去 我不会提起这里发生的一切
1:33:33.99,1:33:36.99 我可以继续为你洗黑钱
1:33:38.89,1:33:41.79 永远不许和我提钱的事 你这个婊子养的
1:33:41.99,1:33:43.69 不许在这间办公室
1:33:43.89,1:33:45.79 不许在任何地方
1:33:45.99,1:33:49.09 进来\N我只是想让你放心 没别的意恩
1:33:49.39,1:33:50.59 禁闭室 一个月 是 长官
1:33:51.59,1:33:52.89 你怎么了?
1:33:53.09,1:33:54.39 把他带出去
1:33:54.59,1:33:56.19 这是我出去的唯一的机会
1:33:56.39,1:33:58.19 这是我的人生!你明白吗?
1:33:58.39,1:34:00.49 带他出去!带他出去!
1:34:02.29,1:34:04.19 关禁闭一个月
1:34:04.39,1:34:07.09 这是我听到过的最严厉的惩罚
1:34:07.29,1:34:08.59 这都是我的错
1:34:08.79,1:34:10.39 废话
1:34:11.09,1:34:13.79 事情不是由你而起的 或让他入罪
1:34:13.99,1:34:16.39 你是说安迪是清白的?
1:34:16.59,1:34:18.59 我是说 真真正正的无辜的?
1:34:18.79,1:34:20.19 看起来是
1:34:20.59,1:34:22.49 天啊
1:34:22.79,1:34:24.59 他到这里有多久了?
1:34:24.99,1:34:28.29 1947 那是多少 19年
1:34:28.49,1:34:31.09 汤姆·威廉姆斯 是 在这
1:34:36.99,1:34:38.09 这是什么?
1:34:38.79,1:34:40.09 校董会来的信
1:34:40.29,1:34:41.79 他竟把它寄出去了
1:34:41.99,1:34:45.99 你会打开它吗?还是打自己的屁股?
1:34:46.19,1:34:48.39 打自己的屁股听起来好一点
1:34:48.89,1:34:51.69 把它还给我 你他妈的
1:34:52.49,1:34:53.89 别这样
1:34:59.29,1:35:01.69 请你扔掉它 好吗?
1:35:07.29,1:35:08.99 他妈的
1:35:21.69,1:35:24.49 那孩子通过了 平均C+
1:35:24.69,1:35:26.79 我想你会喜欢的
1:35:43.09,1:35:44.49 典狱长要见你
1:35:58.29,1:35:59.29 就在这里?
1:35:59.49,1:36:01.79 他是这么说的
1:36:17.89,1:36:18.89 典狱长?
1:36:28.89,1:36:32.89 汤姆 我要你保证这次谈话只有我们两个知道
1:36:34.49,1:36:36.69 我感到很艰难
1:36:55.19,1:36:57.29 这事的情形很特别
1:36:58.09,1:37:00.19 我想你可以体会到
1:37:00.39,1:37:01.69 是的
1:37:01.89,1:37:03.29 我肯定
1:37:03.59,1:37:07.59 告诉你 孩子 这件事让我承受很大压力
1:37:09.09,1:37:11.69 让我半夜惊醒 真的
1:37:13.89,1:37:15.79 应该怎么做
1:37:17.39,1:37:21.19 有时很难让人明白
1:37:22.19,1:37:23.59 你明白了吗?
1:37:25.89,1:37:27.49 我需要你的帮助 孩子
1:37:28.99,1:37:31.09 如果我要继续追查下去
1:37:31.49,1:37:34.59 就不能有丝毫的疑点
1:37:35.39,1:37:36.39 我必须知道
1:37:36.59,1:37:39.29 你跟德弗瑞恩说的是事实吗?
1:37:40.79,1:37:41.99 千真万确
1:37:42.49,1:37:45.49 那么你能在法官和陪审团面前
1:37:45.69,1:37:47.69 手放在圣经上
1:37:47.89,1:37:50.59 向上帝发誓吗?
1:37:50.79,1:37:52.59 只要你给我这个机会
1:37:56.89,1:37:58.19 那也正是我认为的
1:38:45.29,1:38:47.19 我想你已经听说
1:38:48.99,1:38:49.99 那个坏消息了
1:38:51.59,1:38:53.09 一个这么年青的人
1:38:53.39,1:38:55.99 还有一年就要出狱了 还想逃狱
1:38:56.49,1:38:58.99 哈德利队长被迫开枪
1:38:59.79,1:39:01.29 那是事实
1:39:04.29,1:39:06.69 我们不要再去提那件事了
1:39:08.39,1:39:09.59 继续生活
1:39:11.19,1:39:12.69 我已经完了
1:39:13.99,1:39:15.69 一切己结束了
1:39:17.59,1:39:19.99 找其他人帮你做吧
1:39:21.19,1:39:23.09 任何事都没停下来
1:39:24.39,1:39:25.59 任何事
1:39:28.99,1:39:32.09 否则你在此继续熬下去
1:39:32.49,1:39:34.79 再也没有警卫保护你
1:39:34.99,1:39:39.89 我会把你从单人牢房转到同性恋者那里
1:39:41.29,1:39:43.79 你会觉得你被火车操了
1:39:45.19,1:39:46.69 至于图书馆?
1:39:47.29,1:39:48.29 不存在了
1:39:48.89,1:39:51.29 我们用书在院子里烤肉
1:39:51.29,1:39:54.09 会被一块块的砖头封闭起来
1:39:54.09,1:39:56.39 几英里以外都能看见火焰
1:39:56.39,1:39:59.99 我们像土著人那样围着书跳舞
1:40:01.29,1:40:04.29 你明白我的意思了吗?听懂了吗?
1:40:07.99,1:40:09.89 或许我很愚蠢?
1:40:21.69,1:40:24.29 再给他一个月时间考虑清楚
1:41:10.99,1:41:14.09 我妻子曾说过我是个很难理解的人
1:41:14.89,1:41:16.69 像本合着的书
1:41:17.59,1:41:19.59 她经常这样抱怨
1:41:20.49,1:41:22.09 她很漂亮
1:41:24.49,1:41:25.99 上帝 我爱她
1:41:29.69,1:41:31.99 只是我不知道如何表达我的感情
1:41:34.69,1:41:36.39 我杀了她 瑞德
1:41:38.19,1:41:39.99 虽然不是我开的枪
1:41:41.49,1:41:43.19 但是我把她赶走的
1:41:44.69,1:41:47.39 她是因我而死的
1:41:47.59,1:41:48.99 因为我对她的态度
1:41:57.99,1:41:59.79 那不能判你谋杀的
1:42:03.19,1:42:04.99 只能说是坏丈夫
1:42:08.59,1:42:11.89 你可以为此难过 但枪不是你开的
1:42:12.09,1:42:13.39 不是我杀的
1:42:13.79,1:42:15.69 是别人干的
1:42:16.99,1:42:19.09 我在这里做了替死鬼
1:42:21.59,1:42:23.09 运气不好 我想
1:42:28.39,1:42:29.79 霉运到处漂浮
1:42:30.79,1:42:33.09 总要有人承受的
1:42:33.99,1:42:35.89 刚巧轮到我罢了
1:42:36.59,1:42:39.29 我刚好碰上了它
1:42:45.29,1:42:49.19 我只是没有想到会这么久
1:42:53.59,1:42:55.29 想过你有一天能出去吗?
1:42:56.49,1:42:57.49 我?
1:43:00.49,1:43:01.49 有
1:43:02.89,1:43:05.19 有一天 到我头发花白
1:43:05.39,1:43:08.49 头昏眼花的时候
1:43:10.59,1:43:12.19 我告诉你 我会到哪里去
1:43:13.69,1:43:15.29 圣哈塔尼奥
1:43:16.19,1:43:17.39 什么?
1:43:17.69,1:43:19.49 圣哈塔尼奥
1:43:20.49,1:43:22.09 在墨西哥
1:43:23.49,1:43:25.59 太平洋中的一个小地方
1:43:26.79,1:43:29.59 你知道墨西哥人怎么形容太平洋的
1:43:31.39,1:43:33.39 他们说那里是没有记忆的地方
1:43:35.39,1:43:37.99 那就是我想渡过余生的地方
1:43:39.69,1:43:42.19 一个没有记忆的温暖地方
1:43:45.39,1:43:47.29 开间小旅馆
1:43:48.99,1:43:50.49 就在沙滩边上
1:43:51.09,1:43:53.29 买艘不值钱的旧船回来
1:43:53.89,1:43:55.49 把它翻新
1:43:58.19,1:43:59.49 载着我的客人
1:44:00.29,1:44:01.69 出海钓鱼
1:44:05.49,1:44:07.29 圣哈塔尼奥
1:44:10.79,1:44:14.69 在那种地方 我需要个能找到东西的人
1:44:21.19,1:44:23.99 我觉得外面的社会可能不适合我
1:44:30.69,1:44:32.79 我的大半生都在这里渡过
1:44:34.19,1:44:35.99 我已经是这里的一部分了
1:44:36.89,1:44:38.59 就像布鲁克那样
1:44:40.09,1:44:41.79 你看轻了你自己
1:44:42.39,1:44:43.99 我不这样看
1:44:47.79,1:44:51.69 在此我能供应物品给你 但是
1:44:52.49,1:44:54.99 在外面你只需要电话簿黄页分类
1:44:55.19,1:44:57.49 我不知道如何开始
1:44:59.59,1:45:01.19 太平洋?
1:45:03.19,1:45:05.39 那么大的地方会吓死我的
1:45:05.59,1:45:06.89 我不怕
1:45:08.19,1:45:10.89 我没开枪杀我妻子 我也没开枪杀她的情人
1:45:12.69,1:45:15.89 不论我犯了什么错 我都已补偿了
1:45:16.89,1:45:18.39 旅馆 船
1:45:20.19,1:45:22.39 我要的并不太多
1:45:27.29,1:45:29.79 我劝你不要再想了
1:45:29.99,1:45:31.99 那只是你的梦想罢了
1:45:32.39,1:45:34.89 墨西哥在遥远的天边 而你在这里
1:45:35.09,1:45:36.69 这才是现实
1:45:36.99,1:45:39.79 是的 是这样
1:45:41.39,1:45:43.79 它在远方 而我在这里
1:45:46.29,1:45:49.09 我想只有一个简单的选择
1:45:51.99,1:45:53.49 要么忙着活
1:45:54.79,1:45:56.89 要么忙着死
1:46:08.99,1:46:11.69 如果你能出去的话 帮我做件事
1:46:11.89,1:46:14.19 当然可以 安迪 什么事都行
1:46:16.09,1:46:19.89 布克斯顿附近有个草场 你知道在哪里吗?
1:46:21.39,1:46:24.49 那里有许多牧场 有一个很特别
1:46:24.69,1:46:28.69 它有很长的石墙 北边的尽头有棵橡树
1:46:28.89,1:46:31.69 像佛洛斯特「美国著名诗人」的诗描绘的那样
1:46:32.69,1:46:35.19 那是我向我太太求婚的地方
1:46:36.59,1:46:38.69 我们到那里去野餐
1:46:39.09,1:46:41.19 还在橡树下做爱
1:46:41.79,1:46:44.09 我向她求婚 她答应了
1:46:48.09,1:46:49.89 答应我 瑞德
1:46:50.79,1:46:52.39 如果你出去的话
1:46:52.59,1:46:54.09 找到那里
1:46:55.29,1:47:00.09 在墙角下 有块与众不同的石头
1:47:01.19,1:47:04.29 一块黑色的火山玻璃石
1:47:06.89,1:47:09.59 下面埋着我想给你的东西
1:47:10.39,1:47:11.59 是什么 安迪?
1:47:11.99,1:47:13.79 埋在那里的是什么?
1:47:15.39,1:47:17.19 你自己挖出来
1:47:17.39,1:47:18.69 就知道了
1:47:24.59,1:47:26.59 不 我告诉你 他
1:47:27.19,1:47:28.99 他只是在开玩笑
1:47:30.09,1:47:31.79 我真的很担心他
1:47:32.19,1:47:33.59 那就好好看着他吧
1:47:33.79,1:47:37.09 白天还可以 但晚上怎么办?
1:47:38.49,1:47:39.59 上帝
1:47:40.99,1:47:41.79 什么事?
1:47:43.29,1:47:46.09 安迪今天到我这里来过
1:47:46.29,1:47:48.39 他问我要了捆绳索
1:47:48.59,1:47:49.39 绳索?
1:47:49.59,1:47:51.29 六英尺长
1:47:51.49,1:47:52.89 那你给他了?
1:47:53.79,1:47:55.49 当然为什么不呢?
1:47:55.79,1:47:57.29 上帝!海伍德
1:47:57.89,1:47:59.89 我怎么知道?
1:48:00.09,1:48:01.59 还记得布鲁克斯吗?
1:48:03.69,1:48:05.59 不 安迪不会那样做的
1:48:06.19,1:48:07.29 永远不会
1:48:09.29,1:48:10.69 我不敢肯定
1:48:13.49,1:48:15.49 人总有脆弱的一刻
1:48:17.89,1:48:20.09 快点要收工了
1:48:20.39,1:48:22.19 还差一点点了
1:48:39.29,1:48:40.99 今晚有三笔存款
1:48:48.89,1:48:50.79 把我的衣服拿到洗衣处去
1:48:50.99,1:48:52.69 还要擦一下我的鞋子
1:48:52.89,1:48:55.79 - 我要它们看起来像镜子一样亮 - 好的 先生
1:49:01.29,1:49:02.79 你能回来真好 安迪
1:49:03.69,1:49:05.59 你不在的话一切都不一样了
1:49:52.49,1:49:53.49 熄灯
1:50:26.39,1:50:28.89 那是个辗转难眠的长夜
1:50:29.39,1:50:32.09 孤独的黑暗中只有思想
1:50:32.29,1:50:34.99 时间像把快刀
1:50:40.29,1:50:43.29 那是我一生中最漫长的夜晚
1:50:59.19,1:51:00.29 清点人数
1:51:04.79,1:51:07.69 南边三楼 人齐了
1:51:10.79,1:51:13.99 二楼245囚室的人不见了
1:51:14.19,1:51:15.19 德弗瑞恩!
1:51:15.79,1:51:18.19 快出来!不要耍花样
1:51:21.39,1:51:24.79 别要我下来打爆你的头
1:51:32.29,1:51:36.19 他妈的 你不要耽误我 我还有很多事要做
1:51:36.39,1:51:39.69 你最好是病了或者死了
1:51:39.89,1:51:41.19 你听到了吗?
1:51:47.29,1:51:49.39 啊 我的上帝!
1:52:06.39,1:52:08.99 查问这里的每一个犯人
1:52:09.39,1:52:11.99 - 从他的好朋友开始 - 谁?
1:52:14.49,1:52:16.09 打开237号的门
1:52:19.59,1:52:23.29 你什么意思 "他不在这了"?别跟我说这种话
1:52:24.19,1:52:25.49 别再这样说
1:52:25.69,1:52:26.69 但是长官 他真的不在那里
1:52:26.99,1:52:30.39 我看得见!你认为我瞎了吗?
1:52:31.09,1:52:32.49 这就是你想说的吗?
1:52:32.69,1:52:35.39 - 我瞎了吗? - 没有!长官
1:52:36.29,1:52:38.79 那你呢?你瞎了吗?
1:52:39.29,1:52:41.79 告诉我这是什么? 昨晚的查房记录
1:52:41.99,1:52:45.29 你看到德弗瑞恩的名字吗?我确定 就在那里
1:52:45.49,1:52:46.89 "德弗瑞恩"
1:52:48.49,1:52:49.99 他熄灯的时候
1:52:50.19,1:52:51.19 还在囚室里的
1:52:51.39,1:52:53.69 因此今早他也应该在
1:52:54.69,1:52:56.29 我要找到他
1:52:56.59,1:52:59.99 不是明天 不是早饭后 是现在
1:53:00.29,1:53:01.49 是的 长官
1:53:02.49,1:53:04.69 快走
1:53:08.09,1:53:09.09 站好
1:53:10.59,1:53:11.59 那么?
1:53:15.09,1:53:16.09 那么 什么?
1:53:16.29,1:53:19.69 你们常在一起 亲密得像做贼一样
1:53:20.79,1:53:22.29 他肯定对你说过些什么
1:53:22.99,1:53:24.59 没有 先生 狱长
1:53:24.89,1:53:25.89 什么都没说
1:53:27.79,1:53:30.29 主啊 这是个奇迹
1:53:30.89,1:53:33.49 人就像屁一样在风中消失了
1:53:34.19,1:53:35.29 什么都没留下
1:53:36.19,1:53:38.89 只剩下窗台上的石头
1:53:39.09,1:53:41.79 和那墙上的小妞 问问她吧
1:53:41.99,1:53:43.79 也许她知道些什么
1:53:43.99,1:53:46.79 你想说什么?
1:53:48.19,1:53:49.49 我想没有
1:53:50.09,1:53:52.29 为什么她有点特别?
1:53:53.29,1:53:54.99 这是一个阴谋
1:53:55.59,1:53:57.49 肯定是的
1:53:58.09,1:54:01.79 一个该死的大阴谋
1:54:02.09,1:54:04.09 所有人都有参与
1:54:04.69,1:54:05.89 包括她
1:54:40.89,1:54:42.59 在1966年
1:54:42.79,1:54:45.19 安迪·德弗瑞恩
1:54:45.39,1:54:46.99 从肖申克监狱逃了出去
1:54:49.19,1:54:51.79 他们只能找到泥塘中的囚衣
1:54:52.39,1:54:53.99 一块肥皂
1:54:54.19,1:54:55.69 和一个很旧的手槌
1:54:55.89,1:54:58.39 几乎快被削成一小块
1:55:02.89,1:55:07.69 我曾认为用手槌要六百年才能掘通的隧道
1:55:08.29,1:55:10.89 安迪用不到二十年就办到了
1:55:29.19,1:55:31.49 安迪很喜欢地质学
1:55:32.29,1:55:35.49 我能想像这归功于他一丝不苟的本性
1:55:35.89,1:55:37.69 如果这里有一段冰河时期
1:55:38.09,1:55:40.59 百万年后 山脉就会在那里形成
1:55:41.69,1:55:44.49 地质学是关于压力和时间的研究
1:55:45.29,1:55:47.29 需要的仅仅就是这些
1:55:48.09,1:55:49.09 压力
1:55:49.79,1:55:51.09 和时间
1:55:52.39,1:55:54.49 还有一张大海报
1:55:58.49,1:55:59.39 就像我说的那样
1:55:59.89,1:56:03.89 监狱里的人都会找事情来消磨时间
1:56:06.69,1:56:11.49 看起来安迪的爱好是把他的墙搬运到广场上
1:56:12.09,1:56:13.99 每次一把
1:56:15.29,1:56:17.39 我猜在汤姆被杀后
1:56:17.59,1:56:20.59 安迪觉得他在此呆得已够久了
1:56:20.79,1:56:23.29 尽快 我要回家了
1:56:24.09,1:56:26.09 我马上就好了
1:56:47.49,1:56:49.49 今晚有三笔存款
1:56:56.79,1:56:59.09 安迪照他的吩咐
1:56:59.29,1:57:02.79 把鞋擦得闪闪发亮
1:57:06.49,1:57:08.79 警卫完全没有注意到
1:57:09.09,1:57:10.49 我也没有
1:57:10.69,1:57:12.29 说真的
1:57:12.49,1:57:15.49 谁会留意别人穿的鞋子呢?
1:59:18.99,1:59:22.19 安迪朝向自由爬了五百码
1:59:22.39,1:59:25.79 我难以想像有多臭的下水道
1:59:26.79,1:59:29.09 或许我只是不想去爬
1:59:33.49,1:59:35.89 五百码
1:59:36.39,1:59:39.39 有五个足球场那么长
1:59:40.09,1:59:42.59 有半英里左右
2:00:37.89,2:00:42.49 第二天早上 就在那海报被撕下来的时候
2:00:42.79,2:00:45.59 一个从未出现过的人
2:00:45.89,2:00:48.39 走进了缅因州国家银行
2:00:48.99,2:00:52.19 在那一刻前 他从来是不存在的
2:00:52.79,2:00:55.09 除了在纸上 我可以帮忙吗?
2:00:55.49,2:00:57.49 他有所有正确的身份证明文件
2:00:57.69,2:01:01.39 驾驶执照、出生证明、社会安全证
2:01:01.79,2:01:04.29 签名也是正确的
2:01:04.49,2:01:07.59 不能再为你服务真的很遗憾
2:01:07.79,2:01:09.59 希望你在国外生活愉快
2:01:10.39,2:01:11.49 谢谢
2:01:12.09,2:01:13.29 我想我会的
2:01:14.19,2:01:17.49 先生 这是你的本票 还有别的吗?
2:01:17.79,2:01:18.69 请问
2:01:19.29,2:01:21.79 你能帮我把它寄出吗?
2:01:22.29,2:01:23.49 我很乐意
2:01:25.29,2:01:26.69 再见 先生
2:01:27.59,2:01:31.99 史蒂文先生那天早上去了将近十二家银行
2:01:32.49,2:01:34.09 加起来
2:01:34.29,2:01:39.09 他总共提取了三十七万诺顿狱长的钱
2:01:39.79,2:01:42.59 作为十九年的赔偿
2:01:49.89,2:01:51.99 早上好 波特兰时报
2:01:52.49,2:01:55.19 "肖申克监狱 贪污谋杀"
2:02:03.09,2:02:05.49 "主的审判迅速降临"
2:02:22.09,2:02:24.89 "亲爱的典狱长 你说的对"
2:02:24.99,2:02:26.79 "得救之道 就在其中"
2:02:44.09,2:02:47.29 拜伦·哈德利?你有权保持沉默
2:02:47.29,2:02:52.49 否则你所说的一切都将对你不利
2:02:52.99,2:02:56.59 我虽没有亲眼看到 但我听说他被带走时
2:02:56.59,2:02:59.09 哭得像个娘们
2:03:04.39,2:03:08.39 诺顿没有静静离开的意思
2:03:24.29,2:03:25.09 森姆·诺顿?
2:03:25.89,2:03:28.29 我们有拘捕令 开门!
2:03:33.09,2:03:34.19 开门吧
2:03:34.69,2:03:35.99 我不知是哪把钥匙
2:03:46.09,2:03:48.09 别紧张 诺顿
2:03:59.59,2:04:02.99 我想知道当子弹穿过他的头的时候
2:04:03.29,2:04:04.79 他在想些什么
2:04:05.09,2:04:09.49 是在想该死的安迪·德弗瑞恩到底是如何击败他?
2:04:11.99,2:04:15.49 诺顿狱长一伙倒台之后
2:04:15.69,2:04:17.79 我收到了张明信片
2:04:19.29,2:04:22.09 它是空白的 但是邮戳是
2:04:22.29,2:04:24.39 汉格堡 德萨斯州的
2:04:24.99,2:04:26.29 汉格堡
2:04:26.59,2:04:28.29 就在边境那里
2:04:28.69,2:04:30.69 安迪就是从那里出国的
2:04:31.29,2:04:35.29 当我想到他开车向南走的时候
2:04:35.79,2:04:37.99 我总会笑起来
2:04:39.89,2:04:41.39 安迪·德弗瑞恩
2:04:41.79,2:04:43.79 爬过了那臭屎沟
2:04:43.99,2:04:46.39 然后干干净净的到另一边去了
2:04:47.29,2:04:48.59 安迪·德弗瑞恩
2:04:49.39,2:04:50.99 向太平洋进发
2:04:53.99,2:04:56.19 哈德利抓住他的头 对吗?
2:04:56.39,2:05:00.19 他说 "我相信他将会发生意外"
2:05:00.39,2:05:03.19 我们跟他熟的老是谈起安迪
2:05:03.89,2:05:05.59 我发誓 他总是带来话题
2:05:05.79,2:05:08.79 "我的朋友可以要两瓶啤酒"
2:05:09.09,2:05:10.79 他成功了
2:05:11.99,2:05:14.39 有时那令我伤心 虽然
2:05:14.69,2:05:16.09 安迪已经离开了
2:05:16.79,2:05:21.09 我不得不提醒自己有些鸟是不能关在笼子里的
2:05:21.39,2:05:23.49 他们的每一片羽毛都沾着自由的光辉.
2:05:25.19,2:05:26.89 当它们飞走的时候
2:05:27.39,2:05:31.79 你会觉得把它们关起来是种罪恶
2:05:32.79,2:05:34.09 但是
2:05:34.59,2:05:38.89 它们的离开让你生活的地方空荡荡的
2:05:43.09,2:05:45.49 可能我只是想念我的朋友了
2:06:10.19,2:06:11.09 请坐
2:06:16.99,2:06:18.49 瑞德
2:06:19.09,2:06:22.29 你因终身监禁已被关了40年了
2:06:23.09,2:06:25.29 你觉得你已改过了吗?
2:06:27.09,2:06:28.69 改过?
2:06:30.69,2:06:32.59 让我想想
2:06:33.59,2:06:35.99 我不明白那是什么意思
2:06:38.09,2:06:40.29 你有心理准备重新投入社会吗?
2:06:40.89,2:06:43.19 我知道你们是怎么想的 老弟
2:06:45.39,2:06:47.39 对我来说那只是个用来掩饰的词
2:06:48.79,2:06:51.09 政客用的词语
2:06:51.49,2:06:54.99 让你们年青人能穿西装打领带
2:06:55.49,2:06:57.09 有一份好工作
2:06:59.09,2:07:01.19 你倒底想知道些什么?
2:07:01.99,2:07:03.79 我对自己所犯的罪感到后悔吗?
2:07:03.79,2:07:05.49 你有后悔吗?
2:07:06.89,2:07:10.29 没有一天我不感到后悔的
2:07:11.09,2:07:15.09 不是因为我在监狱里 或者你认为我该这样
2:07:17.99,2:07:21.09 我回首过往
2:07:22.69,2:07:24.39 一个年青的
2:07:24.99,2:07:28.99 愚蠢的孩子犯了大罪
2:07:31.49,2:07:33.79 我想和他谈谈
2:07:35.09,2:07:38.19 我想和他讲讲道理
2:07:38.29,2:07:40.79 告诉他做人道理
2:07:42.39,2:07:44.39 但已经不能了
2:07:45.99,2:07:48.59 那孩子已无影无踪
2:07:49.19,2:07:52.49 只剩下这个老人
2:07:53.39,2:07:55.39 我得这样生活下去
2:07:56.19,2:07:58.29 改过?
2:07:58.29,2:08:00.69 只是个狗屁的字眼
2:08:01.09,2:08:03.89 你继续盖上你的印章吧
2:08:03.90,2:08:06.39 老弟 别再浪费我的时间了
2:08:07.09,2:08:09.69 说句实话
2:08:09.69,2:08:12.19 我根本不在乎
2:08:24.79,2:08:26.09 "通过"
2:09:21.79,2:09:23.79 "布鲁斯到此"
2:09:38.19,2:09:40.19 你的 小姐
2:09:42.49,2:09:44.09 我可以去洗手间吗?
2:09:49.39,2:09:54.49 你不用每次都问我 去吧
2:10:06.89,2:10:10.59 四十年来我小便都要经过批准
2:10:10.89,2:10:14.39 不批准的话一滴都尿不出来
2:10:17.39,2:10:20.09 现实是很难面对的
2:10:21.19,2:10:24.69 我不习惯外面的生活
2:10:31.99,2:10:35.99 我总在想怎样才能违反假释条例
2:10:36.49,2:10:39.49 那样他们会把我再送进去
2:10:44.19,2:10:47.19 生活在恐惧中是很可怕的
2:10:47.49,2:10:49.39 布鲁克是知道的
2:10:49.39,2:10:51.89 他知道得太清楚了
2:10:52.89,2:10:56.69 我只想回到能适合我的地方
2:10:56.69,2:10:59.99 令我不用再担心受怕的地方
2:11:01.49,2:11:04.39 只有一件事阻止了我这么做
2:11:05.29,2:11:08.19 我对安迪作出的承诺
2:11:28.19,2:11:29.89 就在那里
2:11:39.89,2:11:42.19 非常感谢 先生
2:11:51.49,2:11:52.79 "布克斯顿"
2:15:20.89,2:15:22.39 亲爱的瑞德
2:15:22.39,2:15:25.09 若你能看到这封信 那你已经出来了
2:15:25.09,2:15:29.39 如果你已来了这么远 也许可以再前进一点
2:15:29.39,2:15:32.49 你还记得那个地方的名字 是吗?
2:15:34.19,2:15:36.29 圣哈塔尼奥
2:15:37.29,2:15:41.29 我需要一个人和我一起工作
2:15:41.39,2:15:45.39 我期待你的到来 计划已经摆好了
2:15:45.79,2:15:47.49 记住 瑞德
2:15:47.49,2:15:49.79 希望是件好东西
2:15:49.79,2:15:51.99 也许是世上最好的东西
2:15:51.99,2:15:54.69 好东西从来不会流逝
2:15:54.69,2:15:57.79 我希望这封信能见到你
2:15:57.79,2:15:59.99 见到你很好
2:15:59.99,2:16:01.49 你的朋友
2:16:01.49,2:16:03.19 安迪
2:16:36.49,2:16:38.39 "要么忙着活
2:16:38.39,2:16:40.89 要么忙着死"
2:16:42.99,2:16:45.69 这话一点都没错
2:16:47.79,2:16:50.19 "瑞德也来过"
2:16:50.39,2:16:52.79 我一生中第二次
2:16:52.79,2:16:55.89 犯了罪
2:16:56.39,2:16:58.89 违反了假释条例
2:16:58.99,2:17:03.29 当然 我怀疑他们会因此设下路障
2:17:03.39,2:17:05.59 尤其是像我这样的老人家
2:17:05.59,2:17:08.19 德萨斯州 汉格堡
2:17:11.29,2:17:16.49 我是如此的激动 以致不能静静地坐下来思考
2:17:16.49,2:17:19.99 我想只有那些重获自由
2:17:19.99,2:17:22.69 即将踏上新征程的人们
2:17:22.69,2:17:25.89 才能感受到这种即将揭开未来神秘面纱的激动心情
2:17:28.29,2:17:31.59 我希望我能成功越过边界
2:17:32.49,2:17:36.09 我希望跨越千山万水握住朋友的手
2:17:37.39,2:17:41.99 我希望太平洋的海水如我梦中那样的蓝
2:17:43.89,2:17:45.09 我希望
2:18:18.79,2:18:23.89 谨此纪念亚伦格林
2:18:24.41,2:18:28.91 懦怯囚禁人的灵魂 希望可以感受自由Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.
