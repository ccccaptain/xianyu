小伙伴们有没有想过当你逐渐老去走到了生命的尽头时，你回顾毕生往事，你最后悔的事都会有哪些呢？有人说没有遗憾的人生是不完美的，因此生命尽头我们后悔的事情可能还不少。国外有一名常年照顾临终病人的护士Bronnie ware，因为工作原因她有机会听到很多人临终前说出他们一生里最后悔的事，所以她为我们总结出了临终之际大多数人最后悔的五件事。

在平常的日子里谁会没事儿去想这些沉重的东西，我们又不会每天去面对这些弥留之际的病人，更加不会听到这些遗言。可是死亡是我们每个人终将面对的事情，从出生那一刻生命的列车就慢慢向人生的终点前进了。所以当那一刻真正来临，对于那时的自己来说什么事情才是最重要的。从青葱岁月里意气风发的少年再到垂垂老矣的老朽，多少人在生命里来去匆匆，回首一生我们有多少遗憾，多少悲伤，多少后悔之事.........

1、我希望当初有勇气过自己真正想要的生活，而不是别人希望我过的生活。
这是所有后悔的事中最常听到的。心理学上有个理论，较之那些我们做过的事，人们后悔的往往是那些没做的事。所以当人们在生命尽头回首往事时，会发现有好多梦想应该实现，但却没有实现。你的生活、工作、感情、伴侣，其实我们多少人一直活在别人的希望和期待里，从来不去想自己真正想要的是什么——又可能，一直以来我们习惯了把别人的希望和寄托当作自己生活的目标。当你疾病缠身时，才发现其实自己应该而且可以放下很多顾虑去追求你想要的生活，似乎为时已晚了。

I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.
“This was the most common regret of all. When people realize that their life is almost over and look back clearly on it, it is easy to see how many dreams have gone unfulfilled. Most people had not honored even a half of their dreams and had to die knowing that it was due to choices they had made, or not made. Health brings a freedom very few realize, until they no longer have it.“

2、我希望当初没有花这么多精力在工作上。
Ware说这是她照顾过的每一个男病人会说的话。因为工作，他们错过了关注孩子成长的乐趣，错过了爱人温暖的陪伴，这是他们最深的后悔与愧疚。其实对于现在的职业女性来讲，这也成为了一个难以平衡和取舍的问题。如果你把生活变得简单一点，你也许会发现有些事情其实并没有那么重要。腾出一些浪费的时间和空间，可能你会过得开心一点。

I wish I hadn't worked so hard.
“This came from every male patient that I nursed. They missed their children's youth and their partner's companionship. Women also spoke of this regret, but as most were from an older generation, many of the female patients had not been breadwinners. All of the men I nursed deeply regretted spending so much of their lives on the treadmill of a work existence.“

3、我希望当初能有勇气表达自己的感受。
太多的人压抑自己的感受与想法，只是为了“天下太平“，不与别人产生矛盾。渐渐他们就变成中庸之辈，无法成为那个更好的自己。其实，有很多疾病与长期压抑愤怒与消极情绪有关。也许你的直言不讳，会得罪某些人。但可能从此以后因为直爽，你们不打不相识；又或者翻脸，这正好让你摆脱这种需要你压抑自己感受才能维持的累人关系。
I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings.

“Many people suppressed their feelings in order to keep peace with others. As a result, they settled for a mediocre existence and never became who they were truly capable of becoming. Many developed illnesses relating to the bitterness and resentment they carried as a result.“

4、我希望当初能和朋友保持联系。
老朋友的好，我们总要到有事了的时候才会想得到。多少人因为自己忙碌的生活而忽略了朋友。很多人临终前终于放下钱、放下权，却放不下心中的情感与牵挂。朋友也好，爱人也罢，其实生命最后的日子里，这些人才是我们最深的惦念。

I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
“Often they would not truly realize the full benefits of old friends until their dying weeks and it was not always possible to track them down. Many had become so caught up in their own lives that they had let golden friendships slip by over the years. There were many deep regrets about not giving friendships the time and effort that they deserved. Everyone misses their friends when they are dying.“

5、我希望当初能让自己活得开心点。
也许有点出乎意料，但这一条也在前五之中。很多人直到生命的最后才发现，“快乐是一种选择“。人们习惯了既定的生活模式，也习惯了人前的假面和伪装。以为是生活让自己不快乐，其实不过是自己为难自己。只有临终的时候才会发现，别人怎么看你根本没那么重要，傻也好，怪也罢，能有真心的笑容，才是最大的快乐。

I wish that I had let myself be happier.
“This is a surprisingly common one. Many did not realize until the end that happiness is a choice. They had stayed stuck in old patterns and habits. The so-called "comfort" of familiarity overflowed into their emotions, as well as their physical lives. Fear of change had them pretending to others, and to their selves, that they were content, when deep within, they longed to laugh properly and have silliness in their life again.“
